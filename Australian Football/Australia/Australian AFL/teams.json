It is based at Princes Park in Carlton, and played its home matches there throughout most of its history, but currently plays its home matches at either Docklands Stadium (currently known as Etihad Stadium) or the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Carlton has historically been one of the AFL's most successful clubs, having won sixteen senior VFL\/AFL premierships throughout its history, equal with Essendon as the most of any club. The club will also field a team in the AFL Women's league upon its establishment in 2017.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "The Essendon Football Club, nicknamed the Bombers, is a professional Australian rules football club. The club plays in the Australian Football League (AFL), the game's premier competition. The club was formed by the McCracken family in their Ascot Vale home \"Alisa\", and while the exact date is unknown, it is generally accepted to have been in 1872.\r\n\r\nThe club's first recorded game took place on 7 June 1873 against a Carlton seconds team. From 1878 until 1896, the club played in the Victorian Football Association (VFA), then joined seven other clubs in October 1896 to form the breakaway Victorian Football League (known as the Australian Football League since 1990). Headquartered at the Essendon Recreation Ground, known as Windy Hill, from 1922 to 2013, the club moved to The Hangar in Tullamarine in late 2013 on land owned by the Melbourne Airport corporation. The club shares its home games between Docklands Stadium and the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Zach Merrett is the current club captain.\r\n\r\nEssendon is one of Australia's best-known and most successful football clubs. It has won 16 VFL\/AFL premierships, which, along with Carlton and Collingwood, is the most of any club in the competition.",

It is named after and based in the city of Melbourne, Victoria, and plays its home games at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).\r\n\r\nMelbourne is the world's oldest professional club of any football code. The club's origins can be traced to an 1858 letter in which Tom Wills, captain of the Victoria cricket team, calls for the formation of a \"foot-ball club\" with its own \"code of laws\". An informal Melbourne team played that winter and was officially formed in May 1859 when Wills and three other members codified \"The Rules of the Melbourne Football Club\"—the basis of Australian rules football. The club was a dominant force in the earliest Australian rules football competition, the Challenge Cup, and was also a foundation member of the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1877 and the Victorian Football League (VFL) in 1897, which later became the national Australian Football League. Melbourne has won 13 VFL\/AFL premierships, the latest in 2021.",

The club's traditional rivals include St Kilda and geographical rivals Essendon.\r\n\r\nThe club has its headquarters and practices at the Whitten Oval in Footscray, an inner-western suburb of Melbourne, Australia. The club draws its supporter base from this traditionally working class area and plays its home matches at Docklands Stadium (currently known as Etihad Stadium) in the Melbourne Docklands area, also in the city's inner-west. In October 1996, the club began to play under its current name of the \"Western Bulldogs\", changing from its original name of the \"Footscray Football Club\". The Whitten Oval underwent a A$20 million redevelopment starting in 2005 to improve the club's headquarters and training facilities.",
