            "strDescriptionEN": "FaZe Clan (formerly FaZe Sniping) is an American esports and entertainment organization that competes in various video game tournaments. The organization was founded as a gaming clan on YouTube by players known as Housecat, ClipZ, and Resistance in 2010.\r\n\r\nCall of Duty\r\nMuch later into the life cycle of Ghosts, FaZe saw yet another roster change; however, this change was the result of personal issues between Parasite and his teammates. Parasite was subsequently benched, but shortly after a very professional ordeal coming out of Censor, his actions were quickly undone as Dedo was traded to Evil Geniuses in exchange for the temporary loan of Karma, and Parasite returned to the active roster.\r\n\r\nAdvanced Warfare\r\nAs Advanced Warfare continued to move along, a deal was struck between FaZe and Denial Esports. FaZe reportedly found that Huke and Slasher were unsettled at FaZe and were seeking other teams. As a result, the organization and key members, ZooMaa and Enable, traded Huke and Slasher for Denial CoD Champions James \"Clayster\" Eubanks and Dillon \"Attach\" Price. The deal established FaZe as a top-three team, and the new squad made strong showings in the Pro League, as well as multiple LAN wins, their first of which being the UMG Dallas 2015 event, where they beat OpTic. Soon after, the squad traveled to Europe to try to win the Gfinity Summer Championship 2015. FaZe ran through the tournament with ease and were pitted, once again, against OpTic in the finals. OpTic picked up a 3-0 lead in the best of seven; however, FaZe made a 4-3 comeback to win the LAN event. Doubts resurfaced about the FaZe team after a poor showing at UMG Washington DC 2015. These did not last for long after they won MLG Pro League CoD AW Season 3 Playoffs.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "The Los Angeles Thieves or LA Thieves is an American professional Call of Duty League (CDL) team based in Los Angeles, California. It is owned by 100 Thieves.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOn November 6, 2020, 100 Thieves announced their expansion in Call of Duty League, following the purchase of the slot previously owned by Immortals Gaming Club under the branding of OpTic Gaming Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nThe team did not obtain a spot in the inaugural 2020 Call of Duty League season.  The re-addition of 100 Thieves to professional Call of Duty was a welcomed homecoming for the organization. This also marked the return of former professional player turned CEO Matthew Haag, to the scene where his career started. The team finished the 2021 Call of Duty League season with a 7th place in the Regular Season, and a 7th\/8th finish at the Championship Weekend. After the end of the season the team released Johnathon \"John\" Perez, Thomas \"TJHaLy\" Haly, Carlos \"Venom\" Hernandez, Austin \"SlasheR\" Liddicoat, and Cuyler \"Huke\" Garland, with Sam \"Octane\" Larew and Dylan \"Envoy\" Hannon joining the team. 2022 was the team's most successful year, winning their first major title at Major IV in New York City, then claiming the 2022 Call of Duty League Championship title.",
