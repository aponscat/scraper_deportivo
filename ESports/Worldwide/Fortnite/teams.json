            "strDescriptionEN": "Cloud9 (C9) is an American esports organization, which fields teams in Rocket League, League of Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, Super Smash Bros. Melee, H1Z1, Fortnite, Clash Royale, Overwatch, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. and Rules of Survival.\r\n\r\nCloud9 formed when Jack Etienne bought the former Quantic Gaming League of Legends roster. Following the success of the Cloud9 LoL team in the North American League of Legends Championship Series, the team was able to expand to field rosters in other esports. In 2015, Cloud9's Heroes of the Storm team won the first Heroes of the Storm World Championship, becoming the inaugural winner of the championship. In 2018, Cloud9's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive roster became the first American team to win a major championship, securing a 2-1 victory against FaZe Clan in the ELEAGUE Boston: Major 2018 final.\r\n\r\nCloud9 has since grown into one of the largest esports organisations in the world, gaining thousands of followers across social media daily. Cloud9 currently sits at #7 on the list of biggest esports organisations by social media following.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nCloud9 has its origins in the League of Legends team of Orbit Gaming, which had several current C9 team members. After Lone Star Clash in November 2012, members of Orbit Gaming signed with Quantic Gaming, which had only been sponsoring a StarCraft II team. Quantic Gaming was an esports team and media company founded in 2010 by Simon Boudreault, a Quebec native who had come upon a large inheritance upon the death of his father and decided to invest nearly all of it in esports. During its existence, several players and coaches claimed that they consistently missed payments from Boudreault. When QG failed to make the 2013 LCS Spring split, Boudreault cut off contact with society and soon dissolved the company. Despite being owed tens of thousands of dollars, former players say they are no longer considering legal action against Boudreault. Former Team SoloMid manager Jack Etienne bought the team for US$15,000 in May 2013 and also became its manager.\r\n\r\nIn July 2014 the C9 Smite team disbanded just before the start of the Smite Pro League. On May 6, 2014 Cloud9 signed Super Smash Bros. Melee player Mang0. Cloud9 acquired CompLexity Gaming's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive team in August 2014. The team left compLexity after it received a better offer from C9 before renewing their contract with their previous team. Cloud9 announced the formation of a Challenger Series team and held open tryouts. On November 26, 2014 Cloud9 added a Halo team by acquiring The Agency, which boasted several experienced players. In December 2014 Cloud9 withdrew their Dota 2 team from the Chinese I-League because of concerns over poor playing and living conditions and were subsequently banned for the next seasons for doing so. In February 2015 Riot suspended C9 Tempest after it was revealed that the team had illegally used a non-roster member during a game. His name was Joe Fuller",

            "strDescriptionEN": "FaZe Clan (formerly FaZe Sniping) is an American esports and entertainment organization that competes in various video game tournaments. The organization was founded as a gaming clan on YouTube by players known as Housecat, ClipZ, and Resistance in 2010.\r\n\r\nCall of Duty\r\nMuch later into the life cycle of Ghosts, FaZe saw yet another roster change; however, this change was the result of personal issues between Parasite and his teammates. Parasite was subsequently benched, but shortly after a very professional ordeal coming out of Censor, his actions were quickly undone as Dedo was traded to Evil Geniuses in exchange for the temporary loan of Karma, and Parasite returned to the active roster.\r\n\r\nAdvanced Warfare\r\nAs Advanced Warfare continued to move along, a deal was struck between FaZe and Denial Esports. FaZe reportedly found that Huke and Slasher were unsettled at FaZe and were seeking other teams. As a result, the organization and key members, ZooMaa and Enable, traded Huke and Slasher for Denial CoD Champions James \"Clayster\" Eubanks and Dillon \"Attach\" Price. The deal established FaZe as a top-three team, and the new squad made strong showings in the Pro League, as well as multiple LAN wins, their first of which being the UMG Dallas 2015 event, where they beat OpTic. Soon after, the squad traveled to Europe to try to win the Gfinity Summer Championship 2015. FaZe ran through the tournament with ease and were pitted, once again, against OpTic in the finals. OpTic picked up a 3-0 lead in the best of seven; however, FaZe made a 4-3 comeback to win the LAN event. Doubts resurfaced about the FaZe team after a poor showing at UMG Washington DC 2015. These did not last for long after they won MLG Pro League CoD AW Season 3 Playoffs.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Ghost Gaming is a North American Esport organization known for its Gears of War team. They also have lineups in Call of Duty, Rocket League and PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS. They ventured into the CS:GO scene originally in April 2017 by acquiring Bee's Money Crew, who were already competing in the Esports Championship Series at the time - whilst also competing for a spot in ESL Pro League which they would successfully qualify for Season 6 over Rush.\r\n\r\nTheir original CS:GO lineup consisted of Matthew \"Wardell\" Bowman Yu, Connor \"CoNnOrRr93\" Glover, Jason \"neptune\" Tran, Sebastian \"seb\" Bucki and Andrew \"ShoT_UP Orlowski with Phong \"bee-1os-\" Nguyên functioning as their coach. ShoT_UP was released shortly after the first month of their lineup joining with the North American organization, due to failing to move to the team's gaming house, with bee-1os- returning to the starting lineup as their in-game leader. After a set of poor results, Ghost Gaming decided to pull the plug on all of their players except for Wardell who they had kept under contract. The trio of bee-1os-, CoNnOrRr93 and neptune would later return under the Bee's Money Crew banner, alongside other talents such as Dallas \"Dallas\" Micks (playing for RONIN at the time) and Joshua \"steel\" Nissan, whom would all play together at Fragadelphia 11 placing 3rd. After the events of Fragadelphia, Ghost Gaming would later reacquire Bee's Money Crew, though Wardell would be left out of the lineup, eventually joining Rogue's new North American team.\r\n\r\nGhost Gaming's second lineup would consist of seb, CoNnOrRr93, neptune, Ronnie \"ryx\" Bylicki and Caio \"zqk\" Fonseca, reigning from Brazil. bee-1os- would also be present in the lineup as the team's coach once again, but was also seen standing in for neptune in ESL Pro League Season 6 due to age restrictions (requiring every player competing to be 16-years-old or older). Joshua \"sancz\" Ballenger would also be present as a backup, though he was never used in any games during his time in the organization. After a short while, Wardell would leave Rogue, after only a week, to rejoin Ghost Gaming in place of neptune, and Dallas would later join the starting lineup in zqk's place. Shortly before ROG Masters 2017 - Americas LAN, Dallas left Ghost, leaving former coach bee-1os- to take his spot. Two months later, the roster would shift again as ryx was kicked from the squad and bee-1os- switched into a managerial role in order to attend college.\r\n\r\nIn the months leading up the beginning of ESL Pro League Season 7, Ghost Gaming would replenish their roster with the addition of Michael \"MAiNLiNE\" Jaber as coach and the additions of Yassine \"Subroza\" Taoufik and Tramaine \"stan1ey\" Stanley to the starting roster. Midway through the EPL season, CoNnOrRr93 was cut from the team, leaving Wardell and seb as the only remaining original members from the first Ghost Gaming squad. Following his departure, his spot was filled by former Rise Nation player Andy \"vSa\" Xu. In the weeks following the end of the EPL season, the team parted ways with MAiNLiNE and benched stan1ey after he expressed a desire to take a break from competitive CS:GO and to return to the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn June 2018, Ghost Gaming would massively overhaul their roster when they signed the 3-man core of Torqued, consisting of: Josh \"steel\" Nissan, Matt \"Pollo\" Wilson, and Kenneth \"koosta\" Suen. This change would see vSa and seb being benched and as a result of Torqued having qualified, Ghost Gaming would attend their first Premier level event: ESL One: Belo Horizonte 2018. A month later, Ghost Gaming would claim victory over Furia eSports at the ZOTAC Cup Masters 2018 - Americas tournament thus qualifying them for the international event. Pollo was soon released by Ghost. As a replacement the team would look to German IGL Kevin \"kRYSTAL\" Amend on a loan from The Imperial. The inclusion of kRYSTAL saw a third AWPer playing for the team.",
