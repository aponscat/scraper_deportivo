It is a leading organisation in console esports, with multiple championship Call of Duty championships achieved from 2011 to 2014. Epsilon's Smite team won the Smite World Championship 2016. The organization is headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, but individual teams are based across Europe and North America.\r\n\r\nThe organization was founded in 2008 by Gregory Champagne, an ex-Tribes player.\r\n\r\nIn early 2010, Epsilon signed the first big significative deal with Razer, creating a first of many partnerships to come with different brands. While Epsilon was built on originally on the Battlefield Series and Team Fortress 2 success, it made the determining move to go in Console, signing a Call of Duty Irish Team composed with players such as Jurd. The team had a good run at the World Championships, ultimately having the best European Call of Duty Finish of all time.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, Epsilon became the first exclusive esports team of Viewsonic, developing new gaming monitors with the French CounterStrike Global Offensive player Richard \"Shox\" Papillion\".\r\n\r\nIn mid 2015, Epsilon signed the Challenger Smite Team Panthera, to eventually became 2016 Smite World Champions.\r\n\r\nIn early 2016, Creative (SoundBlasterX) became sponsor of Epsilon.\r\n\r\nIn mid 2016, Hype Energy became the main sponsor of Epsilon. The team runs the Hype Energy logo on the front of player jerseys and also on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nIn October 2016, Epsilon announced a partnership with AS Monaco where Epsilon's FIFA players would also represent the football club by wearing their jerseys. Daxe was also sold to PSG Esports around this time.",
