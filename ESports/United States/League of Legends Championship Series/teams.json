            "strDescriptionEN": "Cloud9 (C9) is an American esports organization, which fields teams in Rocket League, League of Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, Super Smash Bros. Melee, H1Z1, Fortnite, Clash Royale, Overwatch, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. and Rules of Survival.\r\n\r\nCloud9 formed when Jack Etienne bought the former Quantic Gaming League of Legends roster. Following the success of the Cloud9 LoL team in the North American League of Legends Championship Series, the team was able to expand to field rosters in other esports. In 2015, Cloud9's Heroes of the Storm team won the first Heroes of the Storm World Championship, becoming the inaugural winner of the championship. In 2018, Cloud9's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive roster became the first American team to win a major championship, securing a 2-1 victory against FaZe Clan in the ELEAGUE Boston: Major 2018 final.\r\n\r\nCloud9 has since grown into one of the largest esports organisations in the world, gaining thousands of followers across social media daily. Cloud9 currently sits at #7 on the list of biggest esports organisations by social media following.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nCloud9 has its origins in the League of Legends team of Orbit Gaming, which had several current C9 team members. After Lone Star Clash in November 2012, members of Orbit Gaming signed with Quantic Gaming, which had only been sponsoring a StarCraft II team. Quantic Gaming was an esports team and media company founded in 2010 by Simon Boudreault, a Quebec native who had come upon a large inheritance upon the death of his father and decided to invest nearly all of it in esports. During its existence, several players and coaches claimed that they consistently missed payments from Boudreault. When QG failed to make the 2013 LCS Spring split, Boudreault cut off contact with society and soon dissolved the company. Despite being owed tens of thousands of dollars, former players say they are no longer considering legal action against Boudreault. Former Team SoloMid manager Jack Etienne bought the team for US$15,000 in May 2013 and also became its manager.\r\n\r\nIn July 2014 the C9 Smite team disbanded just before the start of the Smite Pro League. On May 6, 2014 Cloud9 signed Super Smash Bros. Melee player Mang0. Cloud9 acquired CompLexity Gaming's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive team in August 2014. The team left compLexity after it received a better offer from C9 before renewing their contract with their previous team. Cloud9 announced the formation of a Challenger Series team and held open tryouts. On November 26, 2014 Cloud9 added a Halo team by acquiring The Agency, which boasted several experienced players. In December 2014 Cloud9 withdrew their Dota 2 team from the Chinese I-League because of concerns over poor playing and living conditions and were subsequently banned for the next seasons for doing so. In February 2015 Riot suspended C9 Tempest after it was revealed that the team had illegally used a non-roster member during a game. His name was Joe Fuller",

However, in mid-2019 they rejoined the LCS after their parent company, Immortals Gaming Club, bought out OpTic Gaming and their LCS spot.
