On 19 March 2024, the ABA League officially announced BC Dubai would join the league for the next three seasons, starting from 2024. The teams from the league reportedly receive €2.5 million annually from Dubai, who is also paying all travel expenses. Jurica Golemac was signed as the team's first head coach, while Nate Mason was the first officially signed player for the team. Later in the summer, Dubai BC announced that the 17,000 seater Coca-Cola Arena would serve as the team's home arena.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Košarkarski klub Cedevita Olimpija (English: Cedevita Olimpija Basketball Club), commonly referred to as KK Cedevita Olimpija, is a men's professional basketball club based in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The club competes in the ABA League and the EuroCup, as well as in the Slovenian League.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nBackground\r\nMain articles: KK Cedevita and KK Olimpija\r\nKK Cedevita Olimpija is an outcome of a merger of two clubs from neighboring countries, the Slovenian club Petrol Olimpija from Ljubljana and the Croatian team Cedevita from Zagreb, which is the first such instance of two clubs from different countries merging.\r\n\r\nOlimpija is the winner of 17 Slovenian Championships and 20 Slovenian Cups. It traces its history back to 1946 and adopted the name Olimpija in 1955. The club was an early power in the Yugoslav League with Ivo Daneu leading Olimpija to six domestic titles between 1957 and 1970. After Slovenia's independence in 1991, Olimpija won ten out of eleven championships between 1992 and 2002. Olimpija won the FIBA Saporta Cup in the 1993–94 season, and Arriel McDonald and Marko Milič helped it to the 1997 Euroleague Final Four. Over the years, Olimpija had a streak of 17 straight EuroLeague appearances and it won the inaugural Adriatic League in the 2001–02 season. Olimpija won the Slovenian League in 2009 and brought home its sixth straight Slovenian Cup in 2013 before going on a four-year trophy drought. During that span, Olimpija made its EuroCup debut in the 2013–14 season, but it wasn't until the 2016–17 season that it got back to its winning ways with the Slovenian League and Cup \"double\". Olimpija won its most-recent Slovenian League championship in the 2017–18 season.\r\n\r\nCedevita is the winner of five Croatian League Championships and seven Croatian Cup tournaments. It was founded in Zagreb in 1991 as KK Botinec. The club reached the first-tier league in 2002, but its ambitions rose when Atlantic Grupa took over in 2005 and the club changed its name to Cedevita. The club reached the 2011 EuroCup Final Four; Dontaye Draper was named EuroCup MVP while Aleksandar Petrović was EuroCup Coach of the Year. A year later, Cedevita won its first title, the Croatian Cup, led by veteran forward Matjaž Smodiš. Cedevita made its EuroLeague debut in the 2012–13 season, which it finished with a 2–8 record. That turned out to be a title-less season, but the last such for Cedevita, which celebrated a Croatian \"double\" in each of the next five years. In the 2015–16 EuroLeague, Cedevita reached the Top 16. The club also won the inaugural Adriatic Supercup in 2018. In 2019, Cedevita won the Croatian Cup for the sixth season in a row.\r\n\r\nEstablishment\r\nOn 4 June 2019, it was announced that Croatian club Cedevita and Slovenian club Petrol Olimpija plan to merge and form Cedevita Olimpija, a new men's professional basketball club based in Ljubljana, Slovenia. KK Cedevita has a plan to compete in the Croatian League in the future as Cedevita Junior. On 13 June, management boards of Cedevita and Olimpija have confirmed the appointment of Davor Užbinec as a general manager and Sani Bečirovič as a sports director. On 25 June, the EuroCup Board confirmed the club's participation in the 2019–20 EuroCup season. Management boards of Cedevita and Olimpija have separately invited their respective members for their Assembly meetings which took place on 8 July in Arena Stožice, where the club was officially established with Slaven Rimac being confirmed as the first team head coach, as well as Tomaž Berločnik named the president of the club.\r\n\r\nInaugural season\r\nSlovenian forward Edo Murić is the first-ever player who signed for the club. Next to players added from Cedevita and Petrol Olimpija rosters, the club signed veterans Mirko Mulalić, Saša Zagorac, and Marko Simonović, as well as Martin Krampelj, Mikael Hopkins, Jaka Blažič, Codi Miller-McIntyre, and Ryan Boatright. On 11 September 2019, guard Jaka Blažič was named the first team captain. In September 2019, Cedevita Olimpija lost to Partizan in the 2019 ABA Supercup final.\r\n\r\nIdentity\r\nThe main colors of Cedevita Olimpija are green and orange. Those two colors are the main colors of the club founders. Green has been used by Olimpija, while orange was used by Cedevita. The crest is the green Ljubljana Dragon, white framed, on the right next to a capital letter 'C' in orange color and white frame, which stands for Cedevita. In addition, the whole crest is framed with green color.",

Same year club took national championship and cup, and won Triple Crown. KK Partizan was not allowed to defend the Euroleague title in the 1992–93 season, because of UN sanctions.
