The club has won four KBL championship titles (2011–12, 2016–17, 2020–21, and 2022–23).\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nPre-KBL era (1992–1997)\r\nAnyang KGC traces its lineage to the amateur basketball team started by Seoul Broadcasting System (SBS) in 1992. It was one of several basketball teams started by corporate companies hoping to take advantage of the \"basketball craze\" taking place during the early to mid-1990s. Prior to 1997, domestic basketball was an amateur sport and all teams, whether sponsored by a corporate company or a university, participated in the National Basketball Festival (농구대잔치) competition. The SBS team lacked the financial resources to attract the era's biggest stars and was mostly overshadowed by the dominance of the Kia, Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Electronics and the college teams from Yonsei University and Korea University. One of the better-known players from this era was Jung Jae-kun.",
