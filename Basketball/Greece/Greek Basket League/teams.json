Κ.Α.Ε.) or AEK, known in European competitions as AEK Athens, is a Greek professional sports basketball club based in Athens, Greece, part of the major multi-sport club A.E.K..

            "strDescriptionEN": "Aris Basketball Club (Greek: Άρης K.A.E., transliterated into English Aris B.S.A.) known in European competitions as Aris Thessaloniki, is the professional basketball team of the major Thessaloniki-based Greek multi-sport club A.C. Aris Thessaloniki. Aris BC was founded in 1922, eight years after the founding of the multi-sport club and the football team. Their traditional home arena is Alexandreio Melathron (Nick Galis Hall).\r\n\r\nAris BC is one of the most successful Greek basketball clubs of all time, tallying ten Greek League championships and eight Greek Cups, making the Double four times (1986–87, 1987–88, 1988–89, 1989–90). They have also won three European titles: the FIBA Saporta Cup (1992–93), the FIBA Korać Cup (1996–97) and the FIBA EuroCup Challenge (2002–03). They are also one of only two non-relegated teams from the Greek League, with participation in every Greek First Division Championship until today (the other team is Panathinaikos). Aris holds the record for the most straight wins in the Greek League, at an amazing 80 consecutive wins in a row. Before the arrival of Nikos Galis to Aris, and the first European successes of the team, Greek basketball wasn't as competitive as it was in other European countries. Consequently, Aris helped to establish basketball in Greece, and to greatly increase its popularity across the country.\r\n\r\nUnder the leadership of the legendary duo of Nikos Galis and Panagiotis Giannakis, Aris was the dominant force in Greek basketball during the 1980s and early 1990s. It is for this period of dominance that Aris BC has been nicknamed \"The Emperor\", and was voted the most successful Greek sporting club of the 20th century. Aris is also one of the most renown Greek clubs in European basketball, participating in three consecutive FIBA European Champions Cup Final Fours, and later on winning three lower-tier level European titles. The historic win of the FIBA Korać Cup in the 1996–97 season in particular, bolstered the notion that Aris has a unique place in the history of Greek basketball, and in the history of Greek sports in general.\r\n\r\nWell-known notable players that have played with the club over the years, among others, include: Nikos Galis, Panagiotis Giannakis, Nikos Filippou, Lefteris Subotić, Miroslav Pecarski, Reggie Theus, Walter \"The Truth\" Berry, Roy Tarpley, Stojko Vranković, Žarko Paspalj, Edgar Jones, Tiit Sokk, Panagiotis Liadelis, Harold Ellis, Joe Arlauckas, Giorgos Sigalas, José Ortiz, Andrew Betts, Nikos Chatzivrettas, Nestoras Kommatos, Will Solomon, Smush Parker, Michalis Kakiouzis, Dimos Dikoudis, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, Jeremiah Massey, Kostas Papanikolaou, Kostas Sloukas, Bryant Dunston, and Sasha Vezenkov.",

(Greek: Κολοσσός Ρόδου K.A.E.), known as Kolossos H Hotels for sponsorship reasons, is a Greek professional basketball team that is located on the island of Rhodes, in Rhodes City. Kolossos currently plays in the top-tier level of Greek professional basketball, the Greek League. The club was founded in 1963, and also initially featured sports like volleyball and judo in the early 1980s. Today, the focus of the Greek athletic club is on the franchise's men's basketball department.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nEarly years\r\nDue to geographical isolation, and very small financial abilities for most of the club's history, the basketball team was not able to compete at a high level for many years, and was not funded properly. Kolossos was the first Greek basketball team located in the Aegean Sea region.\r\n\r\nRise\r\nIn 2000, the fate of the team finally changed, when Kostas Kostaridis became the new team President, and took over the reins of the club. Kostaridis changed almost the entire club management, and stated that it was the immediate goal of the team to rise from the 3rd-tier level Greek B League, to the 2nd-tier level Greek A2 League, and subsequently, the team did begin to rise up through Greece's club basketball league system.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, head coach Vassilis Fragkias joined the team, and the ascent up into the Greek A2 League division commenced. In the 2004–05 season, Kolossos won the championship of the Greek A2 League, and was therefore automatically promoted up into the top-tier level Greek League, the highest professional basketball league in Greece.\r\n\r\nMerger with Holargos\r\nIn the 2018–19 Greek Basket League season, Kolossos finished in last place in the league. The team was thus facing relegation down to the second-tier level Greek A2 League. However, Kolossos merged with Holargos, and gained their rights to play in the top-tier level Greek League, in the following 2019–20 Greek Basket League season.\r\n\r\nArenas\r\nThrough the 2018–19 season, Kolossos played its domestic Greek Basket League games at the 1,242 seat Venetokleio Indoor Hall. Prior to the 2019–20 season, Kolossos moved into the 1,400 seat Palais des Sports.",

(Greek: ΚΑΕ Παναθηναϊκός), also known simply as Panathinaikos, currently also known as Panathinaikos AKTOR Athens for sponsorship reasons, is the professional basketball team of the major Athens-based multi-sport club Panathinaikos A.O. It is owned by the Giannakopoulos family.\r\n\r\nThe parent athletic club was founded in 1908, while the basketball team was created in 1919, being one of the oldest in Greece. Alongside Aris, they are the only un-relegated teams with participation in every Greek First Division Championship until today.\r\n\r\nPanathinaikos has developed into the most successful basketball club in Greek basketball's history, and one of the most successful in European basketball, creating its own dynasty. They have won seven EuroLeague Championships, forty Greek Basket League Championships, twenty Greek Cups, one Intercontinental Cup, one Greek Super Cup and two Triple Crowns. They also hold the record for most consecutive Greek League titles, as they are the only team to have won nine consecutive championships (2003–2011), as well as for the most consecutive Greek Basketball Cup titles, winning six from 2012 to 2017. Panathinaikos counts one more championship that took place in 1921 and was organized by the YMCA. It is however not recognized by the Hellenic Basketball Clubs Association, as it was before the creation of the Hellenic Basketball Federation. The team plays its home games in the O.A.C.A. Olympic Indoor Hall, which has a maximum capacity of 19,250 for basketball games. Panathinaikos also holds the world record for the longest title-winning streak, spanning 27 seasons, starting in 1995–96 and continuing up until 2021–22. Over these 27 years, Panathinaikos have won at least one title each season and 43 titles overall.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous well-known top class players who have played with the club over the years are Dominique Wilkins, Fragiskos Alvertis, Byron Scott, Nick Galis, John Salley, Dimitris Diamantidis, Antonio Davis, Stojko Vranković, Dino Rađja, Šarūnas Jasikevičius, Dejan Bodiroga, Oded Kattash, Ramūnas Šiškauskas, Panagiotis Giannakis, Fanis Christodoulou, Alexander Volkov, Marcelo Nicola, Hugo Sconochini, Željko Rebrača, Antonis Fotsis, İbrahim Kutluay, John Amaechi, Nikola Peković, Jaka Lakovič, Pepe Sánchez, Kostas Tsartsaris, Mike Batiste, Nick Calathes, Vassilis Spanoulis, Dejan Tomašević, Byron Dinkins, Ferdinando Gentile, Sani Bečirovič, Darryl Middleton, Lazaros Papadopoulos, Žarko Paspalj, Nikos Chatzivrettas, Dimos Dikoudis, Tiit Sokk, Sofoklis Schortsanitis, Jason Kapono, Arijan Komazec, Edgar Jones, Romain Sato, Johnny Rogers, Tony Delk, Drew Nicholas, Stéphane Lasme, Roko Ukić, Robertas Javtokas, Jonas Mačiulis, Ioannis Bourousis, James Gist, Keith Langford, Jimmer Fredette, Kostas Sloukas and Kendrick Nunn. Such players, the successful management of former long-time presidents Pavlos Giannakopoulos and Thanasis Giannakopoulos, as well as the long-time guidance of the most successful coach in EuroLeague history, Željko Obradović, turned Panathinaikos into the most successful team in Europe over the last two-and-a-half decades.\r\n\r\nPanathinaikos is the only team on the European continent to win as many as seven EuroLeague titles (1996, 2000, 2002, 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2024), since the establishment of the modern era EuroLeague Final Four format in 1988 (no other club has won more than four EuroLeague championships in this period). They were also EuroLeague runners-up in 2001. They reached the EuroLeague Final Four twelve times altogether (1994, 1995, 1996, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2024).",
