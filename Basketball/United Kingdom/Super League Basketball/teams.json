            "strDescriptionEN": "The Leicester Riders, officially known as the Jelson Homes Leicester Riders for sponsorship reasons, is a British professional basketball team that play in the British Basketball League (BBL). They are the oldest operating basketball team in the country.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nFounded on 26 April 1967 and then known as the Loughborough All Stars, the Leicester Riders are the oldest club in British basketball.\r\n\r\nThey were founder members of the National Basketball League in 1972 and the BBL in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe Riders were founded by students and lecturers at Loughborough University in April 1967 and were known as the Loughborough All Stars. They were founder members of the National Basketball League in 1972, and the British Basketball League in 1987, and are the oldest club in British basketball operating at the top flight.\r\n\r\nThe club moved from Loughborough to Leicester in 1981, backed by Leicester City Council and Leicester City Bus (hence the change in nickname to \"Riders\"), before moving back to play at Loughborough University in 2000, following the closure of Granby Halls, at a new venue barely a stone's throw from Victory Hall where the club played its first game.\r\n\r\n\r\nLogo used from 2004 until 2013\r\nIn 2004 the Riders agreed a sponsorship deal with De Montfort University (DMU) and moved back to Leicester, where they played their games at the DMU's John Sandford Sports Centre.\r\n\r\nFollowing a difficult period for the Club financially between 2005 and 2007, former director of the team, Mike Steptoe, and the supporters club formed a consortium which raised enough money to keep the side running. Then local business Jelson Homes stepped forward to sponsor the Club and the appointment of general manager Russell Levenston began a turning point for the club. Part of the sponsorship deal with Jelson Homes was to ensure the future of the club by investing in 'basketball in the community' schemes, providing the youth of Leicester with basketball coaching programmes, such as the \"Shoot to the Future\" programme, run with the support of the Police.\r\n\r\nRiders also now have an extensive youth programme for boys and girls, a Women’s team near the top of England Basketball’s Division One, one of the country’s largest Basketball Apprentice schemes at Charnwood College, and a partnership with Loughborough University, led by the Great Britain men’s captain Drew Sullivan, and which includes a GB Futures player, Jamell Anderson, two Great Britain Under 20 men’s internationals and two Great Britain Under 20 women’s internationals, as well as a number of boys and girls in England Under age international teams. Membership in the Club is expected to reach nearly 1,500 this season. The Club’s community programmes reach nearly 15,000 young people in the City and County.\r\n\r\nThe Jelson Homes DMU Leicester Riders secured the BBL Cup in thrilling fashion as they defeated the Newcastle Eagles 80–85 at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham on 13 January 2012, in front of a bumper 7,500 crowd, and live on Sky TV, their first piece of silverware since they won the Cup and the Playoff finals in 2001.\r\n\r\nAfter winning the treble in the 2016–17 and 2017–18 season, Leicester applied for the following Basketball Champions League season. This will mean the first European participation of a British team since Guildford Heat featured in the ULEB Cup in 2007.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "London Lions is a professional basketball team based in London, who compete in the British Basketball League – the top level men's basketball league in the United Kingdom. The club has previously been based in Hemel Hempstead, Watford and Milton Keynes prior to its re-location to London for the 2012–13 season.\r\n\r\nThe franchise’s only trophy success to-date is the BBL Cup title, won in 2008 as the Milton Keynes Lions. The club also operate the Milton Keynes College Lions Basketball Academy in partnership with Milton Keynes College, which was established in 2007 and remains running despite the professional team's departure from Milton Keynes in the summer of 2012.\r\n\r\nFrom the start of the 2013–14 season, the team will be using the Copper Box, originally built for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, as its home venue.\r\n\r\nThe franchise that would become London Lions initially started out in the town of Hemel Hempstead, as the Hemel Hempstead Lakers. The team was named after one of the NBA’s most famous teams, Los Angeles Lakers, and even adopted the famous Lakers colours of Purple and Gold. In 1977, the Lakers entered the National Basketball League’s Division 2, and enjoyed a rather successful rookie season, finishing 5th (from 11 teams) with a 10–10 record. Their second season would be even more successful, with the Lakers finishing second in Division 2 (15–3) and winning promotion to the top-level league Division 1.\r\n\r\nWith entry into the country’s top league ensure, the club received a major sponsorship deal from beverage brand Ovaltine, and as part of the deal were known as Ovaltine Hemel Hempstead. The franchise became a formidable force in Division 1, regularly finishing at the top-end of the table and making many appearances in the Play-off semi-final’s at Wembley Arena, finishing 3rd in 1981. Following the end of the Ovaltine sponsorship and a one-year deal with retailers Poundstretcher, the franchise was rebranded as the Hemel Royals in 1985. Meanwhile on court, the team failed to reproduce the performances of the past few seasons and often settled for mid-table positions. This was a golden period in British Basketball and Hemel regularly brought top American talent from the States. Dick Miller is the greatest defensive player in the franchises history and probably the game as a whole in the UK. The enigmatic Harvey Knuckles is considered one of the greatest players ever to play in Britain. Steve Hale was a fourth round draft pick, Sam Smith scored big points from all round the court and Daryl Thomas was a prolific scorer.\r\n\r\nFor the 1989–1990 season the franchise opted to leave the top-tier (now known as the Carlsberg League due to sponsorship from the Carlsberg Group) and return to the second-tier league, which had been renamed as NBL Division 1. After only one season, and a 4th place finish (14–8), the Royals returned to Carlsberg League. The team finished bottom of the league in the 1992–1993 season with a 4–29 record, and were subsequently relegated back to Division 1, however they were later reinstated and returned to the rebranded BBL for the following season. A dismal spell ensued and over the next decade the team wouldn’t finish outside of the bottom 3, but with the removal of the promotion\/relegation system between the BBL and Division 1, this had little consequence.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "The Surrey 89ers are an English professional basketball team based in Guildford, Surrey, that compete in Super League Basketball.\r\n\r\nThe club was formed in August 2024, following the dissolution of the Surrey Scorchers that competed in the British Basketball League.  Former Great Britain national team player and Scorchers general manager Dan Clark announced the launch of the new Guildford-based franchise, the Surrey 89ers, in the Scorchers' place for the new top-flight basketball competition, Super League Basketball. As part of the announcement, the 89ers will have the same staff, players and front office members, including former Scorchers head coach Lloyd Gardner, while only changing the ownership structure, effectively making it a phoenix club. The team, nicknamed the \"Niners\", refers to 1889, the year in which the modern county of Surrey was established.",
