            "strDescriptionEN": "The Akron Zips men's basketball team represents the University of Akron in Akron, Ohio. The team currently competes in the Mid-American Conference East division. The Zips are currently coached by John Groce. Prior to becoming members of the MAC in 1992, the Zips were members of the Ohio Valley Conference and the Mid-Continent Conference.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the Zips officially announced they had signed a three-year partnership to be outfitted by the LeBron James line by Nike. They are now the only team with a LJ23\/Nike contract. Nike has released several Zips themed versions of LeBron's shoes. Some are available to the public, while others are exclusively for the members of the basketball team.\r\n\r\nThe team first played in the NCAA Tournament in 1986 when Bob Huggins was their coach. The Zips won their first MAC East division title in 1998. In 2006, the Zips received an invitation to the NIT and won their first-ever post season game at Temple University before falling in the second round. In 2007, the team won their second MAC East title and tied the school record for wins in a season in the Division I era with 26. They also made their first-ever appearance in the MAC Tournament Championship game, which they lost on a last-second shot 53–52 to the Miami RedHawks. The loss cost them the MAC's automatic berth and they were subsequently not selected for either the 2007 NCAA Tournament or NIT, despite finishing with a 26–7 record. The Zips posted a 24–11 record (11–5 in the MAC) in 2008 which included a second-straight appearance in the MAC tournament championship game and a berth in the 2008 National Invitation Tournament.",

The program plays in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). In the conference it trails only long-time basketball powerhouse Kentucky in SEC tournament titles, is third behind Kentucky and Arkansas in wins, and is also third behind Kentucky and LSU in SEC regular season conference titles. Alabama was retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA Tournament national champion for the 1929–30 season by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.\r\n\r\nThe men's basketball program has spent most of its history in the shadow of Alabama's football team, but has risen in stature over the past several decades. Under former coach Mark Gottfried, the team achieved a No. 1 national ranking briefly in 2003, and competed for an NCAA Regional Tournament Championship in 2004. The program was notable as a regular conference basketball contender in the 1980s and early 1990s under the direction of coach Wimp Sanderson and in the 1970s under coach C. M. Newton. Alabama has eight NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 appearances. In the 2003–04 season, the team defeated #1-seeded Stanford in the NCAA Tournament, and reached the Elite Eight round where they lost to the eventual national champion, Connecticut.",

The Knights are members of the ASUN Conference for most sports. The Knights had been members of the Division II Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC) from its formation in 1978 until joining the ASUN in 2020. Sprint football, a weight-restricted form of American football, will become Bellarmine's 23rd varsity sport in 2022.\r\n\r\nOn June 18, 2019, it was officially announced that the Knights would join the ASUN beginning in the 2020–21 school year, starting a four-year transition to NCAA Division I. Four Bellarmine teams in sports that are not sponsored by the ASUN have varied homes. Bellarmine has been a member of the Southern Conference (SoCon) for wrestling since it joined the ASUN. The Knights had also been SoCon members in men's lacrosse, a sport in which they have competed as Division I members since the 2005 season (2004–05 school year), before the ASUN reinstated men's lacrosse in the 2022 season. Men's and women's swimming and diving joined the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association, a league with which the ASUN is a partner. Field hockey became a Division I independent for 2020–21, and joined the Mid-American Conference as an affiliate member in July 2021. During the transition period, Knights teams other than men's lacrosse are ineligible for NCAA-sanctioned postseason play. Men's lacrosse is not subject to this restriction because it had been a D-I member before the transition.",

The current head coach is Mark Fox, who began his tenure at Cal in 2019.\r\n\r\nThe team plays its home games at Haas Pavilion, which was long known as Harmon Gym before being heavily renovated with money donated in part by the owners of Levi Strauss & Co. The arena was originally known as Men's Gymnasium and then later Harmon Gymnasium until the late 1990s when it went through renovations which displaced the team for two seasons.",

In 2015, Harvard tied with Yale for the Ivy title with an 11–3 league record. Despite having lost to Yale 62–52 at Lavietes Pavilion on March 6, 2015, just eight days later Harvard won a playoff between the two at the Palestra in Philadelphia to determine the Ivy League's NCAA automatic bid by a score of 53–51. Harvard thereby achieved its fourth straight NCAA Tournament appearance while preventing Yale from reaching the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 53 years. Harvard was eliminated from the 2015 NCAA Tournament by UNC by a score of 67–65 after leading with under one minute to play in the game.",

The Hoosiers play on Branch McCracken Court at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Indiana on the Indiana University Bloomington campus. Indiana has won five NCAA Championships in men's basketball (1940, 1953, 1976, 1981, 1987) – the first two under coach Branch McCracken and the latter three under Bob Knight. Indiana's 1976 squad remains the last undefeated NCAA men's basketball champion.\r\n\r\nThe Hoosiers are tied for sixth in NCAA Tournament appearances (39), seventh in NCAA Tournament victories (66), tied for eighth in Final Four appearances (8), and 11th in overall victories. The Hoosiers have won 22 Big Ten Conference Championships and have the best winning percentage in conference games at nearly 60 percent. No team has had more All-Big Ten selections than the Hoosiers with 53. The Hoosiers also rank seventh in all-time AP poll appearances (560) and sixth in the number of weeks spent ranked No. 1 (54). Every four-year men's basketball letterman since 1973 has earned a trip to the NCAA basketball tournament. Additionally, every four-year player since 1950 has played on a nationally ranked squad at Indiana.\r\n\r\nThe Hoosiers are among the most storied programs in the history of college basketball. A 2019 study listed Indiana as the fifth most valuable collegiate basketball program in the country. Indiana has ranked in the top 20 nationally in men's basketball attendance every season since Assembly Hall opened in 1972, and often in the top five.\r\n\r\nIndiana has two main rivalries including in-state, against the Purdue Boilermakers (see Indiana–Purdue rivalry), and out-of-state, against the Kentucky Wildcats (see Indiana–Kentucky rivalry.)",

Iowa has played in the Final Four on three occasions, reaching the semifinals in 1955 and 1980 and playing in the championship game against the University of San Francisco in 1956.\r\n\r\nIowa basketball was widely successful in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s with a program resurgence under Lute Olson and the tenures of George Raveling and Tom Davis. Under Olson, the Hawkeyes won their last Big Ten regular season championship and went to the 1980 Final Four.\r\n\r\nThey currently play in 15,400-seat Carver-Hawkeye Arena, along with Iowa women's basketball, wrestling, and volleyball teams.\r\n\r\nPrior to playing in Carver-Hawkeye Arena, which opened in 1983, the Hawkeyes played in the Iowa Armory and the Iowa Field House, which is still used today by the school's gymnastics teams. In 2006, the Hawkeyes accumulated a school-record 21 consecutive wins at home before losing to in-state rival Northern Iowa.\r\n\r\nFour Iowa coaches have been inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame: Sam Barry, Ralph Miller, Lute Olson and George Raveling.",

Under Williams, Maryland appeared in eleven straight NCAA Tournaments from 1994 to 2004. He retired in May 2011 and was replaced by former Texas A&M coach Mark Turgeon.\r\nThe Terrapins played in what many consider to be the greatest Atlantic Coast Conference game in history — and one of the greatest college basketball games ever — the championship of the 1974 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament, in which they lost 103–100 in overtime to eventual national champion North Carolina State. The game was instrumental in forcing the expansion of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, thus allowing for at-large bids and the inclusion of more than one team per conference. That Maryland team, with six future NBA draft picks, is considered by many to be the greatest team not to have participated in the NCAA tournament.",

The school competes in the Big Ten Conference in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Wolverines play home basketball games at the Crisler Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Michigan has won one NCAA Championship as well as two National Invitation Tournaments (NIT), fourteen Big Ten Conference titles and two Big Ten Tournament titles. In addition, it has \"won\" an NIT title and \"won\" a Big Ten Tournament that were vacated due to NCAA sanctions. The team is coached by Juwan Howard.\r\n\r\nMichigan has had 31 All-Americans, selected 44 times. Eight of these have been consensus All-Americans, which are Cazzie Russell (two times), Rickey Green, Gary Grant, Chris Webber, Trey Burke, as well as Harry Kipke, Richard Doyle and Bennie Oosterbaan (two-times) who were retroactively selected by the Helms Foundation. Twelve All-Americans have been at least two-time honorees. Russell was the only three-time All-American.\r\n\r\nMichigan basketball players have been successful in professional basketball. Fifty-eight have been drafted into the National Basketball Association (NBA); twenty-six of those were first round draft picks, including both Cazzie Russell and Chris Webber who were drafted first overall. The 1990 NBA draft in which Rumeal Robinson was selected 10th, Loy Vaught was selected 13th, and Terry Mills was selected 16th made Michigan the third of only ten schools that have ever had three or more players selected in the first round of the same draft. Five players have gone on to become NBA champions for a total of nine times and eight players have become NBA All-Stars a total of 18 times. Rudy Tomjanovich coached both the 1994 and 1995 NBA Finals Champions. Glen Rice is one of only nine basketball players to have won a state high school championship, NCAA title and NBA championship.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1990s Michigan endured an NCAA violations scandal, described as involving one of the largest amounts of illicit money in NCAA history, when Ed Martin loaned four players a reported total of $616,000. Due to NCAA sanctions, records from the 1992 Final Four, the 1992–93 season, and 1995–99 seasons have been vacated. Throughout this article asterisks denote awards, records and honors that have been vacated.",

The Lobos won the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) championship in 1964 and 1968, making frequent appearances in national rankings.

Purdue has sent more than 30 players to the NBA, including two overall No. 1 picks in the NBA draft. \r\nThe history of Purdue basketball dates back to 1896 with their first game against the Lafayette YMCA. In the 1902–03 season, head coach C.I. Freeman, in his only season, led them to an undefeated 8–0 record. Upon conclusion of the season, the university recognized the popularity of the sport and made it part of the Purdue University Athletic Association. The Boilermakers began play in the Big Ten Conference three years later, with its first championship coming in 1911 under the direction of Ralph Jones.",

Five years earlier, in the 2010 NCAA Tournament, the 15th-seed Colonials nearly upset No. 9-ranked Villanova in the First Round before losing in overtime. The team is also known for its upset over No. 1-seeded (and 2012 national champion) Kentucky at the buzzer in the opening round of the 2013 National Invitation Tournament and another upset over traditional Big East powerhouse St. John's in the opening round of the 2014 NIT.

The program is classified in the Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and the team competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).\r\n\r\nSyracuse is considered one of the most prestigious college basketball programs in the country with 3 overall claimed National Championships and 1 NCAA Tournament championship, as well being a National Runner-up 2 times and currently holding an active NCAA-record of 49 consecutive winning seasons. Syracuse is ranked sixth in total victories among all NCAA Division I programs and seventh in all-time win percentage among programs with at least 50 years in Division I, with an all-time win-loss record of 2008–908† (.689) as of March 20, 2019. The Orange are also sixth in NCAA Tournament appearances (40), seventh in NCAA Tournament victories (68†), and eighth in Final Four appearances (6).\r\n\r\nThe Orange play their home games at the Carrier Dome. The Carrier Dome is the largest arena in NCAA DI basketball with a maximum capacity of 35,446. Syracuse's home court total attendance has led the nation 25 times, and its per-game season average attendance has been ranked first 14 times since the opening of the Carrier Dome in 1980. The most recent record-breaking game was against Duke in 2019 with the crowd of 35,642 people. The Carrier Dome is often considered one of the best home court advantages in college basketball.\r\n\r\nIn its 42nd year under current head coach Jim Boeheim, the team has compiled an all-time record 38 20-win seasons, including 10 Big East regular season championships, 5 Big East Tournament championships, 34 NCAA Tournament appearances (and 40 all-time), and 3 appearances in the national title game.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, after a lengthy investigation, the NCAA's Committee on Infractions ordered Syracuse to vacate 101 wins from five different seasons. However, the NCAA confirmed that sanctions did not include the removal of any trophies or banners. Therefore, Syracuse claims all of its NCAA Tournaments appearances and conference titles from those years.",

The Volunteers play their home games in Thompson–Boling Arena, on a court nicknamed \"the Summitt\", after former Tennessee women's basketball coach Pat Summitt. Pat Summitt was one of the greatest women’s basketball coaches of all time. She died from Alzheimer's Disease in 2016. She won 8 national championships as the head coach of Tennessee Lady Vols basketball. With a current capacity of 21,678 (formerly 24,535), Tennessee has consistently ranked in the top 15 in the nation in terms of volume of attendance, averaging 14,817 (60.39% capacity) attendance from 1988 through 2006, and averaging 17,194 (79.34% capacity) attendance from 2007 through 2018 after reducing seating capacity prior to the 2007 season. Historically, Tennessee ranks third in the SEC in all-time wins. Many notable players have played collegiately at Tennessee—players such as Ernie Grunfeld, Bernard King, Dale Ellis, and Allan Houston who all played in the NBA.\r\n\r\nThe Volunteers are currently coached by Rick Barnes, who was hired on March 31, 2015 to replace Donnie Tyndall.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "The Texas Longhorns men's basketball team represents The University of Texas at Austin in NCAA Division I intercollegiate men's basketball competition. The Longhorns currently compete in the Big 12 Conference.\r\n\r\nThe University of Texas began varsity intercollegiate competition in men's basketball in 1906. The Longhorns rank 18th in total victories among all NCAA Division I college basketball programs and 25th in all-time win percentage among programs with at least 60 years in Division I, with an all-time win-loss record of 1791–1088 (.622). Among Big 12 Conference men's basketball programs, Texas is second only to Kansas in both all-time wins and all-time win percentage.\r\n\r\nThe Longhorns have won 27 total conference championships in men's basketball and have made 34 total appearances in the NCAA Tournament (11th-most appearances all time, with a 35–37 overall record), reaching the NCAA Final Four three times (1943, 1947, 2003) and the NCAA Regional Finals (Elite Eight) seven times. As of the end of the 2017–18 season, Texas ranks sixth among all Division I men's basketball programs for total NCAA Tournament games won without having won the national championship (35), trailing Kansas State (37), Notre Dame (38), Purdue (39), Illinois (40), and Oklahoma (41).\r\n\r\nThe Texas basketball program experienced substantial success during the early decades of its existence, but its success in the modern era is of relatively recent vintage. After two losing seasons during the program's first five years, Texas suffered only one losing season from 1912 to 1950, achieving a winning percentage of .703 during that span, reaching two Final Fours and one Elite Eight during the first decade of the NCAA Tournament, and receiving retroactive recognition as the 1933 national champion from the Premo-Porretta Power Poll; from 1951 to 1988, the Longhorns finished with losing records 14 times, recorded a winning percentage of .522, and participated in the expanded Tournament only five times. Texas achieved some measures of national recognition during the tenures of head coaches Abe Lemons (1976–82) and Tom Penders (1988–98), but the program rose to its highest level of prominence under the direction of former head coach Rick Barnes (1998–2015). Barnes guided Texas to 16 NCAA Tournament appearances in his 17 seasons with the program, including a school-record fourteen consecutive appearances (1999–2012), as well as fifteen 20-win seasons overall and a school-best thirteen consecutive 20-win seasons (2000–12).\r\n\r\nSince 1977, the team has played its home games in the Frank Erwin Special Events Center, where it has compiled a record of 507–126 (.801) as of January 7, 2019. The team is currently led by fourth-year head coach Shaka Smart.",
