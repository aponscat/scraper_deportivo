In the 17 years that former coach Stew Morrill was at the helm, Utah State had the 4th highest winning percentage in the nation at home, behind only Duke, Kansas, and Gonzaga. As of the end of the 2018-2019 season, the Aggies have an all-time record of 1,604 wins and 1,119 losses.\r\nThe first basketball team on Utah State's campus was organized in 1902 and consisted of only women. A men's team was organized in 1904, at which point the women's club fell into obscurity.\r\nThe Aggies enjoyed mixed success early in their history, notching sporadic NCAA tournament appearances",
