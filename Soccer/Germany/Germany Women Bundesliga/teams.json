However, because the DFB had outlawed women's football from 1955 to 1970 Bayern could only officially register the team in 1970. They won their first national championship in 1976. In 1990 Bayern were founding members of the Frauen-Bundesliga, but they were relegated after next season.\r\n\r\nThe club returned to the Bundesliga in 2000. In 2009, Bayern were runners-up in the Bundesliga, trailing champion Turbine Potsdam by a single goal. In the 2011–12 season on 12 May 2012, FC Bayern Munich dethroned the German Cup title holders 1. FFC Frankfurt with a 2–0 in the 2011–12 final in Cologne and celebrated the biggest success of the club's history since winning the championship in 1976. In 2015 they won the Bundesliga for the first time, without any defeat. They won the 2015–16 Bundesliga, for the second time in a row.",
