            "strDescriptionEN": "Adelaide City Football Club is a soccer club based in Adelaide, South Australia. The club was known historically as Juventus — the original name given to the club by its founders in Adelaide's Italian community.\r\n\r\nAdelaide City is one of Australia's most decorated sides, having been crowned national champion three times. City became one of the founding members of the National Soccer League in 1977, Australia's first national competition of any football code. Only two clubs (South Melbourne and Marconi) have spent more time in the top tier of Australian soccer since national competition began. City competed in the now-defunct NSL for 27 seasons, winning its first title in 1986 under legendary coach Zoran Matić. The club went on to win two more championships under Matić in 1992 and 1994. During its national league stint, City also won the NSL Cup three times – more than any other club – achieving a league\/cup double in 1992. In 1987, it became the first Australian club in history to win a continental title when it claimed the Oceania Club Championship.\r\n\r\nAdelaide City has historically been one of the most prolific producers of players selected for the Australian national team, with the club providing the third most Socceroos of any NSL club behind Marconi and South Melbourne; notable Adelaide City players who have gone on to represent Australia include John and Ross Aloisi, Aurelio and Tony Vidmar, Sergio Melta, John Perin, Milan Ivanović and Alex Tobin. Former City NSL striker and current coach Damian Mori holds the record for the most goals scored in the national domestic league with 240 – 131 of which were scored in City colours. Tobin holds the record for playing the most senior games in Australian domestic competition with 522, including 436 for City.\r\n\r\nSince it withdrew from the NSL just before the league's final season began in 2003, Adelaide City has competed in the National Premier Leagues South Australia. It has won a record 17 first division titles in South Australia, 12 of which came before City entered the NSL in 1977 and a further five since its participation in national competition ended. City has also claimed more Federation Cup titles than any other club, having won the South Australian domestic knockout title on 17 occasions. The club's 2014 cup final win over traditional rival West Adelaide saw it qualify for the 2014 FFA Cup, in which it reached the quarter-finals and became the first NPL club to eliminate an A-League side when it defeated Western Sydney Wanderers 1–0.",
