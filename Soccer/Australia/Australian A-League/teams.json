            "strDescriptionEN": "Adelaide United FC is a professional soccer club based in Adelaide, South Australia, Australia. The club participates in the A-League under license from Football Federation Australia. Adelaide United is the sole team from the state of South Australia. The club's home ground is Hindmarsh Stadium. The club was founded in 2003 to fill the place vacated by Adelaide City in the former National Soccer League (NSL). Adelaide United were premiers in the inaugural 2005–06 A-League season, finishing 7 points clear of the rest of the competition, before finishing 3rd in the finals, The Reds were also Grand Finalists in the 2006–07 and 2008–09 seasons, but failed to win either of the grand finals.\r\n\r\nThe 2009–10 season proved to be a disaster as the club's poor form continued throughout the season with the club ending the season at the bottom of the premiership table for the first time since inception. As of 2012, Adelaide is the only A-League club to be present at the AFC Champions League on four occasions, and progress past the group stage on three occasions. Adelaide United hold the record for the largest win in an A-League game and the most goals scored in one game. Adelaide defeated North Queensland Fury eight goals to one at Hindmarsh Stadium on 21 January 2011 in front of 10,829 fans. The team was also the first in the league to host two hattricks – one to Marcos Flores and the other to Sergio van Dijk. In 2014, Adelaide United were the winners of the first FFA Cup, beating Perth Glory 1-0 in the final.",

The English Football League One's Sheffield United has invested in the Central Coast-based club, and the Mariners has affiliation agreements with several international clubs.\r\n\r\nThe Mariners' main supporters' group is known as the Yellow Army, for the colour of the club's home kit. The club shares a rivalry with Newcastle Jets, known as the F3 Derby, after the previous name of the motorway that connects the cities of the teams. Matt Simon is the Mariners' all-time leading goalscorer as of December 2014, with 43 goals in all competitions. The team record for matches played is held by John Hutchinson, who has appeared in 252 games with the Mariners as of December 2014.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Perth Glory FC is an Australian professional soccer club in Perth, Western Australia. It competes in the country's premier competition, the A-League, under license from Football Federation Australia. Perth Glory is one of three A-League clubs to survive from the now defunct National Soccer League (NSL). Glory entered the A-League competition for the inaugural 2005–06 season, eight years after the club's formation in 1995. Perth has won three league Premierships and two Championships in the two leagues it has competed in.\r\n\r\nThe club plays matches at Perth Oval, a 20,441 seat multi-use venue located close to Perth's CBD. A youth team competes in the National Youth League and the National Premier Leagues. A women's team competes in the W-League. The youth and women matches are played at various locations across Perth, including Percy Doyle Reserve, Walter Road Reserve, and occasionally Perth Oval.\r\n\r\nPerth first showed interest in joining the National Soccer League (NSL) in its inaugural year in 1977. However, a series of logistical problems and financial concerns meant that the league was not keen to include a Western Australian (WA) side. While the state representative side continued to perform well in national and international cup competitions, WA continued to be unrepresented at a senior club level until 1994.\r\n\r\nIn 1994, a group of businessmen led by Joe Claudio formed the Perth Kangaroos IFC. The club competed in the 1994 Singapore Premier League along with the Darwin Cubs. At the time, there were visions of establishing an Asia-Pacific Super League which could become a sporting and financial empire in the east. It turned out to be something of a farce. The Kangaroos finished the league season undefeated and easily won the Singapore league title. However, with dwindling support and resources, the experiment proved to be a financial disaster and Perth Kangaroos IFC soon folded.",
