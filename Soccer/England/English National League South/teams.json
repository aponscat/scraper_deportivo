They are currently members of the Isthmian League North Division and play at Parkside.\r\n\r\nThe club was established in 1927 and played in local leagues until World War II. In 1946 they joined the Thurrock Combination League, and went on to win the Essex Junior Cup in 1948 and 1949. In 1949 the club joined Division Two of the London League. They finished fourth in their first season, and were promoted to Division One. The following season they won Division One, but were not promoted to the Premier Division. However, despite finishing ninth in 1952–53, they were promoted. After finishing seventh, then third in their first two seasons in the Premier Division, they won the division in 1954–55. In 1957 the club switched to the Delphian League, finishing as runners-up in their first season. When the league folded in 1963 they joined Division Two of the Athenian League. After finishing second in 1968–69, the club was promoted to Division One. They won the Division One title in 1970–71, earning promotion to the Premier Division.\r\n\r\nIn 1973 Aveley joined Division Two of the Isthmian League, which became Division One in 1977. They won the Essex Thameside Trophy in 1979–80 and the Hornchurch Charity Cup in 1982–83. In 1985–86 they finished bottom of the division, and were relegated to Division Two North. After finishing second in 1989–90, a season in which they also became the first club from the bottom division to win the League Cup, the club was promoted back to Division One. Although they finished fourth in their first season back in Division One, the club finished bottom of the division the following season, but were not relegated. However, in 1992–93 they finished bottom again and were relegated to Division Two. In 1994–95 the club were relegated to Division Three, where they remained until 2002, when league reorganisation saw them placed in Division One North.\r\n\r\nAveley were transferred to Division One East of the Southern League in 2004, before returning to Division One North of the Isthmian League in 2006. They won the division in 2008–09, and were promoted to the Premier Division.

            "strDescriptionEN": "Enfield Town Football Club is a football club based in Enfield Town, Greater London, England. Established in 2001 as a fan-led breakaway from Enfield, the club are currently members of the Isthmian League Premier Division and play at the Queen Elizabeth II Stadium. The club badge features the Enfield beast.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded on 23 June 2001 by the Enfield Supporters' Trust after Trust members considered that the regime in charge of Enfield no longer had the interests of the club at heart and lacked sufficient will to bring about the return of the club to its home town, having left Southbury Road in 1999. This followed the chairman of Enfield withdrawing from an outline agreement with the Supporters' Trust which would have seen the Trust take over the running of a debt-free club and receiving £100,000 from money from the sale of Southbury Road which was held in an escrow account by Enfield Council. The balance of over £600,000 would have been paid to the chairman.\r\n\r\nThe newly formed club were admitted to the Essex Senior League for the 2001–02 season, three divisions below the Isthmian League Premier Division where Enfield continued to play. The club's first season saw them finish second in the league and win the League Cup, the Capital Counties Feeder Leagues Trophy, and the Middlesex Senior Charity Cup. The following season they won the Essex Senior League, but were not promoted due to ground grading issues. Despite only finishing fourth in the 2003–04 season, in May 2004 the Isthmian League invited the club to join Division Two, but later rescinded the offer. They won the Essex Senior League for a second time in 2004–05, and were promoted to Division One East of the Southern League, which Enfield were also members of. They finished third in their first season in the Southern League, qualifying for the play-offs, where they were beaten 3–1 after extra time in the semi-finals by Wivenhoe Town.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2006 the club were transferred to Division One North of the Isthmian League. The 2006–07 season saw them finish third again, but they lost 4–2 to AFC Sudbury in the play-off semi-finals. At the end of the season Enfield were liquidated and Enfield Town chairman Paul Millington released a statement suggesting that the two clubs should merge and \"return the name of Enfield to the top of the non-league world\". However, the Enfield players, officials and supporters rejected the offer and formed a brand new club named Enfield 1893. Enfield Town qualified for the play-offs again in 2009–10 after finishing fourth. However, after beating Wingate & Finchley 3–2 in the semi-finals, they lost 3–1 in the final to Concord Rangers. In 2011–12 they were runners-up in the division and went on to win the play-offs with a 1–0 win over Needham Market in the final, earning promotion to the Premier Division.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the 2012–13 season the club won the Supporters Direct Cup, defeating Wrexham 3–1. They retained it the following season, beating YB SK Beveren of Belgium 8-2. In 2016–17 they finished fourth in the Isthmian League Premier Division before losing 4–2 to Dulwich Hamlet in the play-off semi-finals. The 2018–19 season saw the club win the Isthmian League's League Cup, beating AFC Hornchurch 2–0 in the final.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Hornchurch Football Club is a football club based in Hornchurch, Greater London, England. They are currently members of the Isthmian League Premier Division and play at the Hornchurch Stadium.\r\n\r\nThe original club was established in 1923 as Upminster Wanderers. They joined the Romford League, which they remained members of until moving up to Division Two East of the Spartan League in 1938, at which point the club adopted the name Upminster Football Club. After spending the 1945–46 season back in the Romford League, winning the league title and the Essex Junior Cup, the club returned to the lower divisions of the Spartan League the following season. The club were promoted to the Premier Division of the league in 1950–51, but left to join the Delphian League in 1952, at which point another name change (this time due to a move to the Hornchurch Stadium) saw them become Hornchurch & Upminster.\r\n\r\nHornchurch & Upminster were Delphian League runners-up in 1958–59, after which the club transferred to the Athenian League. In 1961 they were renamed Hornchurch Football Club. The Athenian League was expanded in 1963, with Hornchurch becoming members of the Premier Division. They were relegated to Division One after finishing bottom of the Premier Division in 1965–66, but won the Division One title the following season to make an immediate return to the Premier Division. The yo-yoing between divisions continued as they were relegated again in 1967–68, promoted from Division One after finishing third in 1970–71, and then relegated again at the end of the 1972–73 season.\r\n\r\nIn 1975 Hornchurch transferred to Division Two of the Isthmian League, which was renamed Division One in 1977. The club were relegated to Division Two at the end of the 1977–78 season saw them relegated to Division Two. In 1980–81 they were Division Two runners-up, earning promotion to Division One. League restructuring led to the club being placed in Division Two North for the 1986–87 season, before another reorganisation in 1991 saw them moved to Division Three. In 2001–02 the club were Division Three runners-up and were promoted to Division One.\r\n\r\nHornchurch went on to finish as runners-up in Division One North in 2002–03 and were promoted to the Premier Division. The 2003–04 season saw the club reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time. After beating Third Division Darlington 2–0 in the first round, they lost 1–0 to Tranmere Rovers in the second. A fifth-place finish in the Premier Division that season (despite a 10-point deduction for going into administration) was also enough for the club to earn a place in the new Conference South. Their first season in the Conference South saw them reach the FA Cup first round again. However, shortly before the match the entire squad was released due to financial problems. With several debutants and youth players, the team lost the match against Boston United 5–2, and subsequently folded the season, the club folded.\r\n\r\nThe club was quickly reformed under the name AFC Hornchurch, and were placed in the Essex Senior League (three levels below the Conference South) by the Football Association on 19 May. In their first season they won the league, as well as the League Cup and the Gordon Brasted Memorial Trophy. Promoted to Division One North of the Isthmian League, the club won that division in 2006–07 to earn promotion to the Premier Division. In 2007–08 AFC Hornchurch finished fourth in the Premier Division, qualifying for the promotion play-offs, in which they were beaten 3–1 by AFC Wimbledon in the semi-finals. The 2008–09 saw the club finish sixth, missing out on the play-offs. They also reached the first round of the FA Cup, losing 1–0 at home to Peterborough United. Although they entered administration in May 2009, the club managed to survive. After a ninth-placed finish in 2009–10 and coming tenth in 2010–11, they were runners-up in 2011–12, qualifying for the play-offs. Following a 3–1 win over Bury Town in the semi-finals, they defeated Lowestoft Town 2–1 in the final, earning promotion to the Conference South.\r\n\r\nTheir first season in the Conference South saw AFC Hornchurch finish 20th, resulting in relegation back to the Isthmian League Premier Division. The 2013–14 resulted in a fifth-placed finish and qualification for the promotion play-offs. In a repeat of the 2011 final, they faced Lowestoft Town following a 1–0 win over Kingstonian in the semi-finals. On this occasion, they lost 3–0 to the Suffolk club. The following season saw them finish 23rd out of 24 clubs in the Premier Division and relegation to Division One North. They finished fifth in 2015–16, again qualifying for the promotion play-offs. After beating Thurrock 2–0 in the semi-final, they were beaten 3–1 by Harlow Town. In 2016–17 a fourth-place finish led to another playoff campaign, with the club losing 1–0 to Thurrock in the semi-finals.\r\n\r\nAFC Hornchurch were champions of the renamed North Division in 2017–18, earning promotion back to the Premier Division. At the end of the following season they were renamed Hornchurch Football Club.",

It was founded in 1908 and plays its home matches at Clarence Park, about 800 yards from the city centre.\r\n\r\nThe club currently competes in the National League South (previously known as the Conference South), the sixth tier of English football. It competed in the Conference Premier (now the National League) during the 2006–07 season, but was relegated back to the Conference South after one season and subsequently suffered a further relegation in 2010–11, before returning to the sixth tier in 2013–14 after beating Chesham United FC 3–1 in the play-off final.\r\n\r\nCity's most famous match was on 22 November 1922 in a fourth round qualifying FA Cup match. Having been held by Dulwich Hamlet to a 1–1 draw at Clarence Park on 18 November, the replay drew a gate of 4,060. City's New Zealand-born goalkeeper W. Tennant did not appear, his place taken by Alf Fearn who was usually a half-back with the reserves. Dulwich put eight goals past him, the winning goal coming in near darkness at the end of extra time. What put the game in the record books was that City scored seven times, with all seven goals being scored by Wilfred Minter. His feat remains the highest tally by a player on the losing side of an FA Cup tie.",

They were relegated at the end of the 2012–13 season after going into administration, but returned to that level, now known as the National League South, in 2015, before being relegated back to the Southern League in 2019.\r\n\r\nThey were founding members of the South Western League in 1951 and won the title five times in their history. Apart from a three-season spell in the 1970s, when they played in the Cornwall Combination after losing their ground as part of a by-pass development, they remained in the South Western League until 2006, when they joined the Western Football League, achieving promotion from Division One to the Premier Division in their first season.\r\n\r\nTruro were FA Cup regulars throughout the 1950s, but subsequently they were sporadic entrants until a permanent return to the competition in the 2006–07 season, their first appearance in 13 years, then in 2017 they reached the first round for the first time in their history losing away to Charlton Athletic. They won the FA Vase in 2006–07.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Welling United Football Club is a professional association football club, based in Welling in the London Borough of Bexley, England. The club's first team play in the National League South, the sixth tier of English football.\r\n\r\nWelling United Football Club was founded in 1963. It began as a youth team, playing in the Eltham & District Sunday League on a park pitch from 1963–64 to 1970–71. From 1971–72 to 1974–75, it played in the Metropolitan-London League Intermediate\/Reserves Division. In 1975–76 it played in the London Spartan League Reserve Division One. It gained senior status in the London Spartan League in 1976, at Butterfly Lane, Eltham. It finished sixth in Division 2 in 1976–77 and was promoted to the Premier Division. In 1977 Welling moved to the Park View Road ground, which had previously belonged to the then defunct Bexley United. It joined the Athenian League in 1978. In 1981 it progressed to the Southern Football League Southern Division.\r\n\r\nAfter just one season at this level the club found itself in the Southern League Premier Division after the league was re-organised. In 1985–86 it won the league title by 23 points and were promoted to the Football Conference.\r\n\r\nAlthough it struggled in the Conference, only twice finishing above 11th place in 14 seasons, it did enjoy cup success during this period, reaching the first round proper of the FA Cup in six successive seasons, on one occasion knocking out Kent's only Football League side, Gillingham. It also made one third round appearance, losing 1–0 at Park View Road to Blackburn Rovers.\r\n\r\nThe club was relegated in 1999–2000 and returned to the Southern League.\r\n\r\nIn the 2003–04 season, under the management of former England World Cup player Paul Parker, the Wings finished in the top half of the Southern League Premier Division and was therefore able to claim a place in the newly formed Conference South. In that season, Parker left the club by mutual consent.\r\n\r\n\r\nWelling playing Millwall in a pre-season friendly at Park View Road.\r\nFormer Coventry City and Republic of Ireland player Liam Daish took charge of the team on a caretaker basis before the permanent position was handed to former Norwich City and Gillingham defender Adrian Pennock, who narrowly missed out on taking the club into the promotion play-offs. Pennock left the club at the end of the 2006–07 season. His last game managing the Wings finished in a 1–1 draw at home to Hayes. Pennock joined Stoke City in a coaching position under his former Gillingham manager, Tony Pulis.\r\n\r\nOn 16 May 2007, Welling United appointed Neil Smith as the new first team manager. However, after only seven months in charge Smith parted company with the club on 7 January 2008. It was mutually agreed between the club and Smith that his reign as Wings boss would end.\r\n\r\nAndy Ford was appointed the new manager of the Wings on 31 January 2008. Despite losing 6–2 to Cambridge City in his first game in charge, Ford guided the Wings to safety and they eventually finished 16th. Welling finished 7th in the Conference South in 2008\/09 under the guidance of Ford. After a poor start to the 2009–10 season Ford resigned stating he didn't think he could achieve what he wanted on the current budget. Jamie Day was announced as the new player\/manager in November 2009.\r\n\r\nOn 12 August 2010, the club was served with a winding-up petition by HMRC, due for a hearing later that month. The Wings were given 14 weeks to pay the outstanding debt to the HMRC, and thanks almost entirely to the supporters were able to raise £60,000 to clear all monies owed. During this period, in a Football Conference Hearing on 16 September 2010, Welling United admitted to a misconduct charge in connection with the outstanding HMRC debt. Resultantly an immediate deduction of 5 points was enforced on the club together with a suspended £5,000 fine.\r\n\r\nDespite the Wings having a transfer embargo enforced upon them and also being deducted 5 points by the Football Conference, all within four weeks of the start of 2010–11 season, Jamie Day's side were competitively competing for the Conference South title. However, even though Welling United were in the top 5 for almost half of the season, a string of poor results in the final month of the campaign saw the Wings miss out on a play-off place by one point, with a final position of 6th.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormer player manager Jamie Day with the Conference South trophy after winning the title in 2013\r\nThe 2011–12 season ended with Welling in 3rd place and after defeating Sutton United 2–1 on aggregate in the play-off semi-finals they narrowly missed promotion in the final, going down 0–1 to Dartford at Princes Park.\r\n\r\nWelling made a return to the top level of non-league football the following season after clinching the Conference South title, 13 years after they last played at the fifth tier of English football. Between 3 November and 5 February, Welling also broke the league's record for consecutive wins with 12 in a row.\r\n\r\nIn December 2014 Jamie Day left Welling by mutual consent. He was replaced by Jake Gallagher and Jamie Turner as caretakers, but on 21 December it was announced that Jody Brown of Grays Athletic would become manager. On 3 March 2015, Jody Brown was relieved of his duties after just one point in his first nine games. Right back Loui Fazakerley was put in charge for \"the foreseeable future\".\r\n\r\nWelling's first televised home match was played on 8 March 2015 in front of the BT Sport cameras losing 1–0 to Altrincham.\r\n\r\nFollowing an impressive run of results, Fazakerley steered The Wings out of the relegation zone and to Conference Premier safety on goal difference above Alfreton Town. Fazakerley was appointed on a full-time basis the same week.\r\n\r\nOn 25 January 2016 Loui Fazakerley was sacked after 10 months in charge, with the club in the National League relegation zone and was replaced with former first team coach under Jamie Day, Dean Frost and Barry Ashby as assistant manager. Jamie Turner also came back as goalkeeping coach.\r\n\r\nFrost's first match in charge was away against FC Halifax Town and finished 1–1, Welling's first goal and point at The Shay.",

During their time in the West Sussex league they were league champions on seven occasions. In May 1900 the club absorbed local rivals Worthing Athletic and a year later moved to its current home, then known as the Sports Ground, now as Woodside Road. In 1905 another rival team, Worthing Rovers, was also absorbed.\r\n\r\nThe club's intriguing nickname of \"The Rebels\" dates from when it resigned from the West Sussex League on a point of principle over a rule change, prior to becoming a founder member of the Sussex County League in 1920. Worthing are also known as \"The Mackerel Men\", a reference to the three fish on the club crest.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 Worthing became founder members of the Sussex County League, where once again they won eight league titles, in fact in the twenty seasons prior to World War II they only finished outside the top four on two occasions.\r\n\r\nIn 1948–49 Worthing joined the Corinthian League but met with little success. In 1963 the Corinthian League disbanded and most of its clubs joined the newly created Athenian League Division One, where Worthing won promotion at the first attempt, although after three seasons in the Premier Division, two successive relegations saw them drop to Division 2.\r\n\r\nAfter managing a return to the top division, Worthing joined the Isthmian League in 1977, initially in Division Two, but by 1983 they had reached the Premier Division under manager Barry Lloyd and in fact finished as runners-up in 1983–84 and 1984–85. After Lloyd's departure to Brighton & Hove Albion, however, the club soon slipped back down to Division Two, finishing bottom of Division One in the 1990–91 season with only 10 points and having conceded a huge 157 goals.\r\n\r\nFormer Northern Ireland international Gerry Armstrong was appointed manager in 1991 and in 1992–93 led the club to promotion back to Division One, which was followed two years later by a return to the Premier Division under John Robson, although Worthing finished bottom in their first season back in the Premier Division and were to remain in Division One until 2004 when the re-organisation of the English football league system saw them moved back to the Premier Division. They were relegated at the end of the 2006–07 season.\r\n\r\nThe club then reached the play-offs under manager Alan Pook two seasons in a row, losing both matches without scoring a goal. Unknown young manager, Simon Colbran then took the helm and soon became a fans' favourite as the Rebels topped the league for much of Autumn and Winter. Despite several budget cuts, the Rebels finished third and narrowly missed out in the play offs at home to Godalming.\r\n\r\nFormer Brighton & Hove Albion player Adam Hinshelwood was appointed Worthing manager in December 2013 and lost his first game away at Burgess Hill 4–1. In January 2015 the playing budget at the club was completely cut and its debts revealed to be around £200,000. The future of the club looked in serious doubt until March 2015 when local football enthusiast George Dowell became the majority shareholder in the club with plans to invest in various areas. On 10 June 2015, Hinshelwood resigned from the club to take up a full-time coaching post at Brighton & Hove Albion. He was replaced by assistant manager Jon Meeney and 29-year-old defender Gary Elphick.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, Worthing were promoted to the Isthmian League Premier Division via the play-off, having finished the 2015-16 season in third place in the southern division. Player-manager Gary Elphick was on the scoresheet in the play-off final. In late 2017, Adam Hinshelwood returned to the club as first team manager.",
