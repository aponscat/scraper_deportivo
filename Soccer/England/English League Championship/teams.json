In 1890, Rovers moved to Ewood Park. Blackburn Rovers have been English champions three times, and have won six FA Cups, one Football League Cup and one Full Members' Cup. The club has spent most of its existence in the top flight of English football.\r\n\r\nIn 1992, Rovers gained promotion to the new Premier League a year after being taken over by local entrepreneur Jack Walker, who installed Kenny Dalglish as manager. In 1995, Rovers became Premier League champions. In the 1998–99 season, the club was relegated. It was promoted back to the Premier League two years later, in the 2000–01 season, before suffering relegation again in the 2011–12 season. Rovers have not returned to the Premier League since. It has qualified for the UEFA Champions League once, and the UEFA Cup six times: once as League Cup winners, four times through league position and once via the Intertoto Cup.\r\n\r\nThe club's motto is \"Arte et Labore\", meaning \"By Skill and Hard Work\" in Latin.

They currently play in the Championship after winning League One during the 2014–15 season. In sealing the League One title, Bristol City became only the second team to win both the third-tier championship and Football League Trophy double during the same season.\r\n\r\nBristol City won the Welsh Cup – despite being an English club – in 1934. In 1907 they finished runners-up in Football League Division One, which is their highest ever final position. In 1909 they lost the FA Cup final to Manchester United, their only final. Since relegation in 1911, however, they only returned to the top division from 1976 to 1980 and did not contend for any honours then. In 1982, Bristol City became the first English club to suffer three consecutive relegations. They were promoted to the Football League Championship in the 2006–07 season after finishing second in League One but failed to make a second consecutive promotion to the Premier League after they were defeated by Hull City in the 2008 Football League Championship play-off Final at Wembley Stadium. With victories in 1986, 2003 and 2015, Bristol City are now the most successful team in the Football League Trophy.\r\n\r\nThe club's nickname is \"The Robins\", and a robin featured on the club's badge from 1976 to 1994. Official club merchandise, including replica kits, still has a label showing a robin. An attempt by the club to alter the badge was abandoned after it was criticised fiercely by fans. The team's main rivals are Bristol Rovers in the Bristol derby and Cardiff City in the Severnside derby, along with other regional teams in the West Country derby.",

Founded on 18 May 1882, it was one of the first to become professional (in 1883), and subsequently put pressure on the Football Association to permit payments to players. The club entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1885–86 and was one of the 12 founder members of the Football League in 1888–89. From the 1950s until the 1970s, under chairman Bob Lord, the club became renowned for its youth policy and scouting system, and was one of the first to set up a purpose-built training ground.\r\n\r\nBurnley have been champions of England twice, in 1920–21 and 1959–60, have won the FA Cup once, in 1913–14, and have won the FA Charity Shield twice, in 1960 and 1973. They have been runners-up in the First Division twice, in 1919–20 and 1961–62, and FA Cup runners-up twice, in 1946–47 and 1961–62. Burnley are one of only five sides to have won all four professional divisions of English football, along with Wolverhampton Wanderers, Preston North End, Sheffield United and Portsmouth. When the team won the 1959–60 Football League, the town of Burnley became one of the smallest to have an English first-tier champion.\r\n\r\nThe team have played home games at Turf Moor since 1883, after they had moved from their original premises at Calder Vale. The club colours of claret and blue were adopted before the 1910–11 season in tribute to the then Football League champions Aston Villa. The club is nicknamed \"the Clarets\" because of the dominant colour of its home shirts. Burnley's current emblem is based on the town's coat of arms. The team have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Blackburn Rovers, with whom they contest the East Lancashire Derby.",

Dal 1883 disputa le proprie partite interne allo stadio Turf Moor.\r\n\r\nIl Burnley ha vinto due volte la First Division (1920-1921 e 1959-1960), una volta la FA Cup (1913-1914) e due volte il Charity Shield (1960 e 1973). Insieme al Preston North End e al Wolverhampton Wanderers, è una delle sole tre squadre ad aver vinto almeno una volta tutte le prime quattro maggiori divisioni calcistiche professionistiche inglesi. A livello internazionale, il club ha raggiunto come suo miglior risultato i quarti di finale della Coppa dei Campioni nella stagione 1960-1961.\r\n\r\nIl Burnley ha trascorso la maggior parte della propria storia tra la prima e la seconda divisione inglese, ma è rimasta fuori dalla massima serie dal 1976 al 2009.

            "strDescriptionEN": "Cardiff City Football Club is a professional football club based in Cardiff, Wales that competes in the English football league system. The club played in the Premier League for the first time in the 2013–14 season, at the end of which they were relegated. They play their home games at the Cardiff City Stadium, after moving from Ninian Park in 2009.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded as Riverside A.F.C. in 1899 and is the only club from outside England to have won the FA Cup, which they won in 1927. The club won the Football League Championship title in the 2012–13 season and were promoted to the top flight for the first time in 51 years. This followed two lost national cup finals, the 2008 FA Cup Final against Portsmouth and the 2012 Football League Cup Final against Liverpool, the latter being settled by a penalty shootout.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Cardiff City was rebranded by the club's Malaysian owner, Vincent Tan. This included a controversial change of the club's home colours from blue to red.\r\n\r\nRiverside A.F.C. was formed in 1899 as a way of keeping players from the Riverside Cricket Club together and in shape during the winter months. Their first season saw them playing friendlies against local sides at their Sophia Gardens ground, but in 1900 they joined the Cardiff & District League for their first competitive season. In 1905 Cardiff was granted city status by King Edward VII, and as a result the club put in a request to change their name to Cardiff City, but the request was turned down as they were deemed to be not playing at a high enough level. To combat this they arranged to join the South Wales Amateur League in 1907 and the following year they were granted permission to change the name of the club to Cardiff City.\r\n\r\nInterest in the club began to rise during this time, but they were forced to turn down the opportunity to join the newly formed Southern League Second Division due to the lack of facilities at their Sophia Gardens ground. Over the next two years Cardiff welcomed many of Britain's top sides to Cardiff, including Middlesbrough, Bristol City and Crystal Palace, with the matches being played at various grounds in Cardiff and nearby towns. The club would eventually move into their new ground, Ninian Park, in 1910. The club made its first signing the following year with the acquisition of Jack Evans from fellow Welsh club Cwmparc FC.\r\n\r\nWith the new ground in place, Cardiff joined the Southern League Second Division, and Bartley Wilson was quick to hire the club's first manager in Davy McDougall, who became player-manager. Their first match was a 2–1 defeat to Aston Villa, in which new signing Evans scored the only Cardiff goal. They went on to finish in fourth place in their first year in the league. They stayed in the division for the next decade, apart from when the league was suspended due to the outbreak of World War I.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Coventry City Football Club is a professional football club based in Coventry, West Midlands that temporarily plays its home games in Birmingham. They play in the EFL Championship, the second tier of the English football league system following promotion in the 19-20 season.\r\n\r\nCoventry City formed as Singers F.C. in 1883 following a general meeting of the Singer Factory Gentleman's club. They adopted their current name in 1898, joining the Football League in 1919. They won their only major trophy in 1987 when they beat Tottenham Hotspur 3–2 to win the FA Cup. They are one of only five clubs to have won both the FA Cup and the FA Youth Cup in the same season. They have also reached two Football League Cup semi-finals; in 1981 and 1990. They returned to Wembley in April 2017, defeating Oxford United 2–1 to win the Football League Trophy, and again in May 2018, beating Exeter City 3–1 to gain promotion to EFL League One via the play-offs.\r\n\r\nThe club, nicknamed the Sky Blues because of the colour of their strip, was an inaugural member of the Premier League in 1992 and spent 34 consecutive seasons in the English top-flight until relegation in 2001. Following eleven seasons in the second-tier Football League Championship, Coventry were relegated to League One in 2012, the first time they had been in the third tier since 1964. In 2017, there was a further relegation, with the club dropping to the fourth tier of English football for the first time since 1959. They gained promotion back to League One the very next season. Following two seasons in League One, Coventry were promoted back to the EFL Championship in 2020, winning their first league championship in 53 years.\r\n\r\nCoventry has qualified for European competitions twice. In the 1970–71 season, the team competed in the European Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (now the UEFA Europa League), reaching the second round. Despite beating Bayern Munich 2–1 in the home leg, they had lost 1–6 in the first leg in Germany, and thus were eliminated. The team was unable to compete in the 1987–88 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, due to the ban on English clubs at that time, following the Heysel disaster.\r\n\r\nFrom 1899 to 2005, Coventry City played at Highfield Road, which in 1981 became the first all-seater stadium in English football. In the late 1990s, the club's directors decided that a larger stadium was necessary, and so chose a site in the Rowley's Green area of the city. The 32,609-capacity Ricoh Arena was opened in August 2005 to replace Highfield Road. However, the club have left the Ricoh on two occasions and currently do not have an agreement to return.",

The club's competitive peak came in the 1970s when they were twice English League Champions and competed in major European competitions on four separate occasions, reaching the European Cup semi-finals, as well as winning several minor trophies. Additionally, the club was a strong force in the interwar years and won the 1945–46 FA Cup.\r\n\r\nThe club adopted its now traditional black and white club colours in the 1890s and appropriated its club nickname The Rams, a tribute to its links with the First Regiment of Derby Militia, which took a ram as its mascot and the song \"The Derby Ram\" as its regimental song, at the same time. Home games are played at the iPro Stadium, located in Pride Park, Derby, where the club moved in 1997.

Formed in 1876, they have played at the Riverside Stadium since August 1995, their third ground since turning professional in 1889. Their longest-serving home was Ayresome Park, where they played for 92 years, from 1903 to 1995.\r\n\r\nThey were one of the founding members of the Premier League in 1992. The club's main rivals are Sunderland and Newcastle United, however the club also takes part in Yorkshire derbies with several other Yorkshire clubs; most notably Leeds United.\r\n\r\nThe club's highest league finish to date was third in the 1913–14 season and they have only spent two seasons outside of the Football League's top two divisions. The club came close to folding in 1986 after experiencing severe financial difficulties before the club was saved by a consortium led by then board member and later chairman Steve Gibson. Middlesbrough were controversially deducted three points for failing to fulfil a fixture against Blackburn Rovers during the 1996–97 Premier League season and were subsequently relegated. They were promoted the following season and spent eleven consecutive seasons in the top division before relegation. Middlesbrough won the League Cup in 2004, the club's first and only major trophy. They reached the 2006 UEFA Cup Final in May 2006 but were beaten by Spanish side Sevilla. On 24 May 2009, Middlesbrough were relegated to the Championship, failing to extend their 11-year stay in the Premier League.\r\n\r\nThe club's traditional kit is red with white detailing. The various crests throughout the club's history, the most recent of which was adopted in May 2007, incorporate a lion rampant.",

From then until 1993 the club played at The Den, a now-demolished stadium in New Cross, before moving to its current home stadium nearby, also called The Den.\r\n\r\nThe traditional club crest is a lion rampant, referred to in the team's nickname \"The Lions\". Millwall's traditional kit consists of blue shirts, white shorts and blue socks. Millwall have a long-standing rivalry with West Ham United. The local derby between the two sides has been contested almost 100 times since 1899. In the media, Millwall's supporters have often been associated with hooliganism, with numerous films having been made fictionalising their notoriety. The fans are renowned for their chant \"No one likes us, we don't care\" which is sung to the tune of Sailing by Rod Stewart.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, the team reached the final of the FA Cup and, in doing so, qualified for the UEFA Cup the following season, playing in Europe for the first time in their history. The club has also reached FA Cup semi-finals on another four occasions, in 1900, 1903, 1937 and 2013. Millwall have spent the majority of their existence competing in the second or third tier of the Football League. The team spent two seasons in the top flight between 1988–90, in which the club achieved its highest ever finish of tenth place in the First Division. Based on all results during the club's 87 seasons in the Football League from 1920–21 to 2013–14, Millwall are ranked as the 40th most successful club in English football.",

The team plays in League One, the third tier of English football.\r\nFounded in 1893 as Headington United, Oxford United adopted its current name in 1960. It joined the Football League in 1962 after winning the Southern Football League, reaching the Second Division in 1968. After relegation in 1976, between 1984 and 1986 the club earned successive promotions into the First Division, and won the League Cup in 1986. However, Oxford was unable thereby to enter the 1987 UEFA Cup because of the UEFA ban on English clubs in European competitions. Relegation from the top flight in 1988 began an 18-year decline which saw the club relegated to the Conference in 2006, becoming the first winners of a major trophy to be relegated from the Football League. After four seasons, Oxford returned to League Two in 2010 via the playoffs, and six seasons later achieved promotion to League One, after finishing 2nd in League Two in 2016.\r\nRon Atkinson holds the club record for the most overall appearances with 560, John Shuker holds the record for the most appearances in the Football League with 478 and Ron's late brother Graham Atkinson holds the record for the most goals scored with 107. In total, nineteen players have made international appearances while playing for the club. United's home ground is the Kassam Stadium in Oxford and has a capacity of 12,500. United moved to the stadium in 2001 after leaving the Manor Ground, their home for 76 years. Swindon Town is the club's main rival.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Plymouth Argyle Football Club is a professional association football club based in the city of Plymouth, Devon, England. The team competes in the EFL Championship, the second level of the English football league system. The club has played at Home Park since 1901. \r\n\r\nThe club takes its nickname, \"The Pilgrims\", from an English religious group that left Plymouth for the New World in 1620. The club crest features the Mayflower, the ship that carried the pilgrims to Massachusetts. The club has predominantly played in yellow and white throughout their history, with a few exceptions in the late 1960s and early 1970s when white was the colour of choice. A darker shade of green, described (by some) as 'Argyle green', was adopted in the 2001–02 season, and has been used ever since. The city of Plymouth is the largest in England never to have hosted top-flight football. They are the most southerly and westerly League club in England and the only professional club named Argyle.\r\n\r\nOriginally founded simply as Argyle in 1886, the club turned professional and entered both the Southern League and Western League as Plymouth Argyle in 1903. They won the Western League title in 1904–05 and the Southern League title in 1912–13, before winning election into the Football League Third Division in 1920. Finishing as runners-up on six consecutive occasions, they eventually won promotion as Third Division South champions under the long-serving management of Bob Jack in 1929–30. A 20-year stay in the Second Division ended in 1950, though they returned again as Third Division South champions in 1951–52. After another relegation in 1956 they again proved too strong for the third tier, winning the Third Division title not long after in 1958–59.\r\n\r\nArgyle were relegated out of the Second Division in 1968, 1977 and 1992, having won promotion out of the Third Division as runners-up in 1974–75 and 1985–86. They were relegated into the fourth tier for the first time in 1995, and though they would win immediate promotion in 1995–96, they were relegated again in 1998. Promoted as champions under Paul Sturrock with 102 points in 2001–02, they secured a record fifth third tier league title in 2003–04, and would remain in the Championship for six seasons until administration and two successive relegations left them in League Two by 2011. In 2016–17 Argyle won promotion to League One, and again in 2019–20 following relegation the previous season.",

During this period, Portsmouth were recognised to have a large number of international footballers, including England players Glen Johnson and Jermain Defoe, as well as Peter Crouch, David James and Sol Campbell. However, financial problems soon set in and Portsmouth were relegated to the Football League Championship in 2010. In 2012 they were again relegated, to League One, and again, in 2013, to League Two. They began the 2013-14 season in the fourth tier of the English football league system for the first time since the late 1970s.\r\n\r\nPortsmouth became the largest fan-owned football club in England, after the Pompey Supporters Trust (PST) successfully gained possession of Fratton Park in April 2013.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Sheffield Wednesday Football Club is a professional association football club based in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. The team will compete in League One, the third tier of the English football league system, in the 2021–22 season after finishing 24th in the 2020–21 Championship. Formed in 1867 as an offshoot of The Wednesday Cricket Club (itself formed in 1820), they went by the name of the Wednesday Football Club until changing to their current name in 1929.\r\n\r\nWednesday is one of the oldest football clubs in the world of any code, and the third-oldest professional association football club in England. In 1868 its team won the Cromwell Cup, only the second tournament of its kind. They were founding members and inaugural champions of the Football Alliance in 1889, before joining The Football League three years later. In 1992, they became founder members of the Premier League. The team has spent most of its league history in English football's top flight, but they have not played at that level since being relegated in 2000.\r\n\r\nThe Owls, as they are nicknamed, have won four league titles, three FA Cups, one League Cup and one FA Community Shield. Wednesday have also competed in UEFA cup competitions on four occasions, reaching the quarter-finals of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1963. In 1991, they defeated Manchester United 1–0 in the Football League Cup Final as a tier 2 team. As of 2019 they remain the last team to win one of English football's major trophies while outside the top flight\r\n\r\nIn the 19th century, they played their matches at several stadiums around central Sheffield, including Olive Grove and Bramall Lane. Since 1899, the club has played all its home matches at Hillsborough stadium, a near-40,000 capacity stadium in the north-west Sheffield suburb of Owlerton. Wednesday's biggest rivals are Sheffield United, with whom they contest the Steel City derby.",

It competes in the Championship, the second tier of English football.\r\n Swansea City represent England when playing in European competitions, although they have represented Wales in the past. They play their home matches at the Liberty Stadium.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1912 as Swansea Town and joined the Football League in 1921. The club changed their name in 1969, when it adopted the name Swansea City to reflect Swansea's new status as a city.\r\n\r\nIn 1981, the club were promoted to the original Football League First Division. It was during the following season they came close to winning the league title, but a decline then set near the season's end before finishing sixth, although a club record. It was from here the club suffered a relegation the season after, returning to the Football League Fourth Division a few seasons later, then narrowly avoided relegation to the Football Conference in 2003. Prior to playing home matches at the Liberty Stadium, the team had previously hosted at the Vetch Field. The Swansea City Supporters Society Ltd owns 20% of the club, with their involvement hailed by Supporters Direct as \"the most high profile example of the involvement of a supporters' trust in the direct running of a club\". The club's subsequent climb from the fourth division of English football to the top division is chronicled in the 2014 film, Jack to a King – The Swansea Story.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Swansea were promoted to the English Premier League, becoming the first Welsh team to play in it since its formation in 1992. On 24 February 2013, Swansea beat Bradford City 5–0 to win the 2012–13 Football League Cup (the competition's highest ever winning margin for the final), winning the first major trophy in the club's history and qualifying for the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League, where they reach the Last 32 stage but lost over two legs to SSC Napoli.",

The club competes in the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football. \r\n\r\nThe club recognises its foundation as 1881, aligned with that of its antecedent, Watford Rovers, and was established as Watford Football Club in 1898. After finishing the 1914–15 season as Southern League champions under the management of Harry Kent, Watford joined the Football League in 1920. The team played at several grounds in their early history, including what is now West Herts Sports Club, before moving to Vicarage Road in 1922. They have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Luton Town.\r\n\r\nGraham Taylor's tenure as manager at the club between 1977 and 1987 saw Watford rise from the fourth tier to the first. The team finished second in the First Division in 1982–83, competed in the UEFA Cup in 1983–84, and reached the 1984 FA Cup Final. Watford declined between 1987 and 1997, before Taylor returned as manager, leading the team to successive promotions from the renamed Second Division to the Premier League for one season in 1999–2000. The club played again in the highest tier in 2006–07 under Aidy Boothroyd's management, and then again from 2015 to 2020, reaching the 2019 FA Cup Final, their second FA Cup Final. In April 2021, Watford were promoted back into the Premier League having spent just one season in the Championship.",

They will compete in the EFL Championship for the 2021-22 season after being relegated from the Premier League. The club was formed in 1878 and has played at its home ground, The Hawthorns, since 1900.\r\n\r\nAlbion was one of the 12 founding members of the Football League in 1888, the first professional football league in the world. The club has spent the majority of its existence in the top tier of English football, where as of 2020–21 it has played for 82 seasons. The club has been champions of England once, in 1919–20, and has been runners-up twice. Albion teams have reached ten FA Cup finals and won the Cup on five occasions. The first win came in 1888, the year the league was founded, and the most recent in 1968, the club's last major trophy. It also won the Football League Cup at the first attempt in 1966. The club's longest continuous period in the top division spanned 24 years between 1949 and 1973, and from 1986 to 2002 it spent its longest ever spell out of the top division.\r\n\r\nThe team has played in navy blue and white stripes for most of the club's history, and the club badge features a throstle perched on a hawthorn branch. Albion has a number of long-standing rivalries with other West Midlands clubs, with its traditional rivals being Aston Villa and Wolves. Albion contests the Black Country derby with the latter.",

            "strDescriptionIT": "Il West Bromwich Albion Football Club, noto semplicemente come West Bromwich Albion o con l'acronimo WBA, è una società calcistica inglese con sede nella città di West Bromwich, nelle West Midlands. Milita in Championship, seconda serie del campionato inglese di calcio.\r\n\r\nFondato nel 1878, ha militato in massima serie per la maggior parte della sua storia. Nel palmarès della squadra figurano un campionato vinto nella stagione 1919-1920 e cinque FA Cup.\r\n\r\nI giocatori e i tifosi sono soprannominati Baggies e i colori sociali sono il blu scuro (navy) e il bianco. L'origine del soprannome è incerta, anche se quasi sicuramente venne utilizzato la prima volta durante le prime gare casalinghe a The Hawthorns. Una delle teorie suggerisce che il termine derivi dai larghi pantaloni (baggy trousers) che i lavoratori delle fonderie locali indossavano per proteggersi dal ferro fuso. Lo stemma rappresenta un tordo (throstle, nel linguaggio del Black Country) su un ramo di biancospino (hawthorn) con uno sfondo a strisce verticali blu e bianche; da questo deriva Throstles l'altro soprannome di giocatori e tifosi, che esultano con il caratteristico “boing boing” saltellando up and down sul posto.\r\n\r\nFino a luglio del 2016 il maggiore azionista di WBA Group Ltd era la WBA Holdings Ltd una compagnia controllata da Jeremy Peace che deteneva l'87.8% del capitale,[1] ma in seguito all'accordo raggiunto con la cordata di investitori cinesi guidata da Guochuan Lai, uomo d'affari a capo della Yunyi Guokai Shanghai Sports Development Ltd,[2] che acquisisce l'88% del capitale, il WBA diviene la prima squadra di Premier League ad essere di proprietà di un gruppo cinese.[3] Al posto di Jeremy Peace, presidente in carica da 14 anni, viene nominato John Williams, ma a febbraio del 2018 sarà sostituito da Mark Jenkins[4] ed in seguito il ruolo di chairman verrà assunto da Li Piyue.\r\n\r\nLa squadra gioca nello stadio The Hawthorns, che dopo l'ultimo rifacimento nell'estate del 2014 ha una capienza ufficiale di 26.850 spettatori.[5]. L'Albion inaugurò l'impianto il 3 settembre 1900 pareggiando 1-1 la gara contro il Derby County; il record di spettatori si ebbe il 6 marzo 1937, quando 64.815 spettatori assistettero al 3-1 del West Brom contro l'Arsenal, nei quarti di finale di FA Cup.",
