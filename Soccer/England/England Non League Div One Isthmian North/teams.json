            "strDescriptionEN": "Brentwood Town Football Club is a football club based in Brentwood, Essex, England. They are currently members of the Isthmian League North Division and play at the Brentwood Centre Arena. \r\n\r\nA Brentwood Football Club was established in the 19th century, and played in the FA Cup several times, reaching the quarter-finals in 1885–86, where they were beaten 3–1 by eventual winners Blackburn Rovers. They were also briefly members of Division One of the South Essex League for the 1896–97 season, but left after finishing bottom of the division. The club were later replaced as the town's main club by amateur club Brentwood & Warley. Brentwod & Warley joined Division One A of the South Essex League in 1921 and were runners-up in their first season in the league. They finished bottom of Division One in 1926–27, but were runners-up the following season, after which they joined Division One East of the Spartan League.\r\n\r\nLeague reorganisation at the end of the 1928–29 season saw Brentwood & Warley placed in the Premier Division, where they remained until leaving the league at the end of the 1933–34 season. They rejoined the league in 1948, and were runners-up in 1948–49. In 1951 they were founder members of the Delphian League and were its inaugural champions. The club went on to win the league again in 1958–59 and 1959–60. In 1963 they joined Division Two of the Athenian League in 1963 after the Delphian League was disbanded.\r\n\r\nIn 1965 the club turned professional and became Brentwood Town. Playing at the Hive on Ongar Road, the renamed club left the amateur Athenian League to join the Metropolitan League. After two third-place finishes and a League Cup win in 1966–67, the club moved up to Division One of the Southern League in 1967. In 1968–69 they won Division One, and were promoted to the Premier Division. In the same season the club also reached the second round of the FA Cup, where they lost 10–1 at Southend United. The following season the club reached the third round of the cup; they beat Football League club Reading 1–0 in the first round, before defeating Hendon 2–0 in the second round. The third round saw them drawn at home against Northampton Town, with a record crowd of over 4,000 seeing the club lose 1–0. In the league the club briefly topped the table in September, and eventually finished ninth. However, at the end of the season the club directors decided to merge the club with Chelmsford City. The club's ground was sold for housing.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Brightlingsea Regent Football Club is an English football club based in Brightlingsea, Essex. Formed by a merger of Brightlingsea United and Regent Park Rangers in 2005, they are currently members of the Isthmian League Premier Division and play at North Road.\r\n\r\nBrightlingsea United was founded in 1928 by a merger of Brightlingsea Athletic (originally established as Wesley Guild in 1908, before being reformed in 1921) and Brightlingsea Town (established as Brightlingsea Juniors in 1919). The new club played in Division One the Essex & Suffolk Border League, and in 1929 moved to the North Road ground. They were runners-up in Division One (Junior) in 1929–30, and in 1931 they were promoted to the Premier Division. In 1946–47 they won Division One, and were promoted back to the Premier Division. They were relegated back to Division One in 1954 and returned to the Premier Division as Division One champions in 1961, also jointly winning the Division One Knock-Out Cup following a 1–1 draw with Silver End. However, they were relegated back to Division One after a single season and did not return to the Premier Division until finishing as Division One runners-up in 1968 saw the club promoted. In 1971–72 the club won the League Cup, beating Halstead Town 2–1 in the final.\r\n\r\nIn 1972 they joined the Essex Senior League. They won the title in 1988–89 and 1989–90, before joining the Division One of the Eastern Counties League in 1990. They finished as runners-up in their first season, and were promoted to the Premier Division. However, they returned to Division One after finishing bottom of the Premier Division in 1992–93. The club resigned from the league shortly before the start of the 2002–03 season after the manager and most of the players left, complaining about a lack of proper changing facilities. The first team replaced their reserves in Division Two of the Essex & Suffolk Border League and were relegated to Division Three at the end of the season. When Division Three was disbanded in 2005, the club was moved back to Division Two. That year the club merged with youth club Regent Park Rangers to form Brightlingsea Regent. The newly merged club won Division Two at the first attempt, and were promoted again the following season after finishing second. In 2010–11 the club won the Premier Division and the A.V. Lee Service Memorial Cup, and were promoted to Division One of the Eastern Counties League.\r\n\r\nThe 2012–13 season saw the club finish third in Division One, earning promotion to the Premier Division. They also won the First Division Knock-Out Cup, beating Great Yarmouth Town 1–0 in the final. The following season Brightlingsea finished second in the Premier Division, earning promotion to Division One North of the Isthmian League. The 2016–17 season saw them finish the season as Division One North champions, earning promotion to the Premier Division.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Haringey Borough Football Club is a football club based in Tottenham in the London Borough of Haringey, England. Formed in 1973 by a merger of Edmonton and Wood Green Town, they are currently members of the Isthmian League Premier Division and play at Coles Park.\r\n\r\nThe club was established in 1973 by a merger of Edmonton and Haringey Borough (formerly Wood Green Town), and was initially named Edmonton & Haringey. The new club took Edmonton's place in Division One of the Athenian League, and adopted their current name after finishing bottom of the division in 1975–76. The league was reduced to a single division in 1977 and the club finished bottom of the league in 1981–82.\r\n\r\nWhen the Athenian League was disbanded at the end of the 1983–84 season, Haringey joined Division Two North of the Isthmian League. With many of the players and the management team leaving shortly before the start of the 1988–89 season, the club dropped out of the league, before joining the Premier Division of the Spartan League for the 1989–90 season. In 1990–91 the club won the London Senior Cup. In 1995 they were renamed Tufnell Park, taking the name of one of the clubs that had merged to form Edmonton, but reverted to the Haringey Borough name the following year. When the Spartan League merged with the South Midlands League in 1997 to form the Spartan South Midlands League, the club were placed in Premier Division South for the 1997–98 season; a seventh-place finish saw them placed in the Premier Division for the following season.\r\n\r\nHaringey were relegated to Division One at the end of the 2006–07 season, which had seen them finish bottom of the Premier Division. However, they were Division One runners-up the following season, earning an immediate promotion back to the Premier Division; the season also saw them win the Division One Cup. In 2011–12 the club won the league's Challenge Trophy. At the end of the season they were transferred to the Essex Senior League, where their Coles Park tenants Greenhouse London also played. The 2014–15 season saw the club win the Essex Senior League, earning promotion to Division One North of the Isthmian League.\r\n\r\nIn 2016–17 Haringey finished fifth in Division One North, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. However, they lost 5–4 to Maldon & Tiptree in the semi-finals. The club finished fourth in the division the following season, and after beating Heybridge Swifts 2–0 in the semi-finals, they won the final 3–1 against Canvey Island to secure promotion to the Premier Division. The 2018–19 season saw the club reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, going on to lose 1–0 at home to AFC Wimbledon. In October 2019, the Haringey players left the pitch during an FA Cup fourth qualifying round game against Yeovil Town after the Haringey goalkeeper, Valery Pajetat, was reportedly spat at and hit by an object thrown from the Yeovil Town end. The Metropolitan Police announced their intention to investigate the incident.",
