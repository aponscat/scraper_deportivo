Their colours are white with navy blue and red trim.\r\n\r\nTelford United, then playing in the Football Conference, experienced severe financial difficulties towards the end of the 2003–04 season following the collapse of the Miras Contracts business of chairman and sole shareholder Andy Shaw. The club went into administration, and although supporters raised around £50,000 in two months, the club's debts totalled over £4 million, resulting in liquidation on 27 May 2004. On the same day, Telford United Supporters Limited announced that a new club would be formed, which was named A.F.C. Telford United; a new club motto, numquam obliviscere (never forget) was also adopted. In June the new club were placed in Division One of the Northern Premier League by the Football Association. Bernard McNally was appointed as manager and a new squad assembled.\r\n\r\nThe new club's first season saw them finish third in Division One, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. After beating Eastwood Town 1–0 in the semi-final, they defeated Kendal Town 2–1 in the final to earn promotion to the Premier Division. The attendance of 4,215 for the final was a club record. The following season saw them finish tenth. During the season, McNally was replaced as manager by Rob Smith. In 2006–07 the club finished third, having missed the chance to win the league when they lost 2–1 at home to eventual champions Burscough on the final day; the attendance of 5,710 being a new club record. However, they qualified for the promotion play-offs, and a 2–0 win over Marine in the semi-final, they defeated Witton Albion 3–1 to earn promotion to the Conference North.\r\n\r\nTelford finished second in the Conference North in 2007–08, again qualifying for the playoffs, in which they lost 4–0 on aggregate to Barrow. The 2008–09 season resulted in a fourth-place finish and another play-off campaign. After beating Alfreton Town 5–4 on aggregate in the semi-finals (a 2–0 win at home and a 4–3 defeat away), they lost 1–0 to Gateshead. The season also saw them reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, where they were drawn at home to Football League club Southend United. Following a 2–2 draw, the club lost 2–0 in the replay. In the FA Trophy they reached the semi-finals, losing 4–2 on aggregate to York City. However, they were victorious in the Conference League Cup, beating Forest Green Rovers 3–0 on penalties after a 0–0 draw.\r\n\r\nIn 2009–10 Telford finished eleventh in the league, resulting in the sacking of Smith and his replacement with Andy Sinton. Sinton's first season saw them finish as runners-up again. In the play-offs they defeated Nuneaton Town 3–2 on aggregate in the semi-final, before beating Guiseley 3–2 in the final with an injury-time winner by Phil Trainer, earning promotion to the Conference National. They also reached the first round of the FA Cup again, losing 3–1 at home to Lincoln City.\r\n\r\nThe 2011–12 season saw Telford finish twentieth, one place above the relegation zone. Another appearance in the first round of the FA Cup resulted in a 4–0 defeat at Chelmsford City. Sinton left the club mid-way through the following season, and was replaced by Mark Cooper, who remained in charge for only six games, before resigning to take a coaching role at Swindon Town. He was replaced by Graham Hyde, who lasted just two games, resigning after a defeat to Macclesfield Town. John Psaras took over for the remainder of the season, which saw them finish bottom of the division and be relegated to the Conference North. Liam Watson was appointed as manager in May 2013.\r\n\r\nIn 2013–14 Telford won the Conference North, earning an immediate return to the Conference Premier. However, the following season Watson was sacked in December with the club bottom of the division and replaced by Steve Kittrick. They finished 23rd, resulting in relegation back to the North division. However, the season also saw them reach the second round of the FA Cup for the first time; after beating Basingstoke Town 2–1 in a first round replay, they lost 1–0 at Bristol City. In August 2015 Kittrick was sacked and Rob Smith returned for a second spell as manager. They reached the first round of the FA Cup again in 2017–18 but lost 1–0 at Hereford.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Aldershot Town Football Club is an English association football club based in Aldershot, Hampshire. The club participates in the Conference Premier, the fifth tier of English football. The club was founded in the spring of 1992 after the closure of debt-ridden Fourth Division club Aldershot F.C..\r\n\r\nAldershot Town play at the Recreation Ground in Aldershot. They competed in Football League Two from 2008 to 2013 but were relegated from the Football League at the end of the 2012–13 season. Aldershot Town entered administration on 2 May 2013.\r\n\r\nIn March 1992, the town of Aldershot was without a football club after Aldershot F.C. became the first Football League team to fold during the football season since Accrington Stanley in 1962. Aldershot Town was born later the same year, and began life competing in the Isthmian League Division Three. Despite Aldershot Town playing five divisions lower than the Football League, the attendance for their first competitive fixture was higher than the old team's last home tie. Ten successive victories were recorded under the guidance of former player Steve Wignall and Aldershot won the championship by an 18-point margin.\r\n\r\nA further promotion and an FA Vase quarter-final placing was achieved in the 1993–94 season. When Steve Wignall departed to take charge of Colchester United mid-way through the 1994–95 season, former Nottingham Forest winger Steve Wigley took over. The club finished the 1994–95 season with a run of six successive victories, but missed out on promotion by goal difference. After narrowly missing out during the next two seasons Wigley left in July 1997 to become Youth Development Officer at Nottingham Forest. He was replaced by George Borg. Attendances continued to rise during this period and the final fixture of the 1997–98 Isthmian League First Division championship-winning season, at home to Berkhamsted Town, attracted 4,289 people to the Recreation Ground – a league record. The success under Borg continued with an Isthmian League Cup, two Hampshire Senior Cups and a runners-up spot in the Isthmian League Premier Division.\r\n\r\nThe club's reserves were reinstated in 2000–01 and entered the Suburban League. The FA Cup in 2000–01 saw Aldershot take on league opposition at The Recreation Ground for the first time since reforming, when Brighton & Hove Albion visited for a 1st Round tie in November and a record attendance of 7,500 saw the league team win. In the following season's FA Cup the Shots held Bristol Rovers to a home draw in the First Round, but again missed out on the Second Round after losing the replay in Bristol.\r\n\r\nGeorge Borg resigned as manager in November 2001 after pressure from supporters and was replaced by Terry Brown. He won his first game in charge beating Newport IOW 1–0 in the Hampshire Senior Cup Semi-final Second Leg, taking The Shots on to win the final against Havant & Waterlooville. In Brown's first full season in charge he overhauled the squad, and by mid-November the Shots were top of the table, a position they did not relinquish for the remainder of the season, winning promotion to the Football Conference. The club also retained the Hampshire Senior Cup with a 2–1 win over Bashley.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Ashton United Football Club is a football club, based in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, England. They are currently members of the Northern Premier League Premier Division and play at Hurst Cross.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1878 as Hurst Football Club and the earliest known match report dates back to a game against Hurst Red Star on 16 March 1879. They originally played in black-and-white stripes and were nicknamed the Lambs. The club first entered the FA Cup in 1883, beating Turton 3–1 in the first round, and then Irwell Springs 3–2 in the second. However, the result was annulled after a protest from Irwell, and it was they who advanced to the third round after Hurst refused to play the replay. In 1885 they won the first edition of the Manchester Senior Cup, beating Newton Heath (now Manchester United) 3–0 in the final. In the same year they reached the second round of the FA Cup again. However, although they defeated Halliwell 3–1, the result was annulled again. Ashton refused to play the replay and Halliwell advanced to the third round.\r\n\r\nThey joined the Ashton & District League in 1891, but after finishing ninth in the league in the 1891–92 season, it was reported in June 1892 that the club had folded. They were reformed in 1909, and were admitted to the Manchester League as it was expanded from 16 to 18 clubs. In their first season in the league, they finished level on points at the top of the table with Salford United, resulting in a play-off for the championship, which Salford won 2–1.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing sixth in 1910–11, Hurst won the title in 1911–12 and subsequently joined Division Two of the Lancashire Combination. Although they only finished fifth in 1912–13, they were promoted to Division One of the league for the 1913–14 season. Due to the outbreak of World War I, the club did not compete in 1915–16, but re-entered a wartime edition of the league for the 1916–17 season, winning the title. However, they did not compete during the following season. They resumed in the Lancashire Combination in 1918–19, but switched to the Cheshire County League in 1923. Players started wearing red shirts, earning the club a new nickname – the Robins.\r\n\r\nShortly before World War II, the club signed Dixie Dean, but the outbreak of hostilities limited him to a handful of appearances for the club. Following the war, the club resumed playing in the Cheshire County League for the 1945–46 season, changing their name to Ashton United on 1 February 1947. Despite finishing second bottom of the league in 1946–47, they applied for election to the Football League, but the four Football League clubs were re-elected without a vote being taken. They subsequently rejoined the Lancashire Combination in 1948 and were placed in Division One.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing twelfth in 1960–61, the club resigned from the league in order to apply to rejoin the Cheshire County League; in a ballot, they defeated by Altrincham and Wigan Athletic, and so had to rejoin the Lancashire Combination. However, Division One was now full, so the club had to drop into Division Two, which they won in 1961–62 to earn promotion back to Division One.\r\n\r\nIn 1964 the club switched to the Midland Counties League, where they played for two seasons before moving back to Division Two of the Lancashire Combination in 1966. Two seasons later, they moved across to the Cheshire County League, where they remained until it merged with the Lancashire Combination to form the North West Counties League in 1982. The club were placed in Division One of the new league, but were relegated to Division Two after finishing second-from-bottom in 1983–84. After winning Division Two in 1987–88 they were promoted back to Division One.\r\n\r\nThe 1991–92 season saw the club win the Division One title, earning promotion to Division One of the Northern Premier League. They remained in the division until a third-place finish in 2001–02 saw them qualify for the promotion play-offs. After a 3–1 win over Spennymoor United in the semi-finals, a 2–1 win over Bamber Bridge in the final saw them promoted to the Premier Division. During the season, Ashton's Gareth Morris scored one of the fastest goals in FA Cup history, netting after only four seconds against Skelmersdale United.\r\n\r\nWith the creation of the Conference North in 2004, a 14th-place finish in 2003–04 saw the club play-off against Hyde United and Bradford Park Avenue for the right to play in the new league. Following a 2–1 win over Hyde, they lost 2–1 to Bradford Park Avenue in the final. However, after Hucknall Town were denied promotion due to ground grading issues, Ashton took their place in the Conference North. The following season saw them finish second-from-bottom, resulting in relegation back to the Northern Premier League's Premier Division. In 2010 the club were ordered to pay £32,000 to Marcus Hallows after he was injured playing against Ashton for Altrincham.\r\n\r\nIn 2011 the club won the Northern Premier League Challenge Cup, beating Northwich Victoria 1–0 in the final. After finishing fifth in 2013–14 the club qualified for the promotion play-offs; however, after beating FC United 2–1 after extra time, they lost the final to AFC Fylde on penalties after a 1–1 draw. The 2014–15 season saw a third-place finish, again qualifying for the promotion play-offs, in which they lost on penalties to local rivals Curzon Ashton after a 1–1 draw. A third consecutive play-off campaign followed a fourth-place finish in 2015–16, but saw the club lose 3–1 to Salford City in the semi-finals.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Aveley Football Club are a football club based in Aveley, Essex, England. They are currently members of the Isthmian League North Division and play at Parkside.\r\n\r\nThe club was established in 1927 and played in local leagues until World War II. In 1946 they joined the Thurrock Combination League, and went on to win the Essex Junior Cup in 1948 and 1949. In 1949 the club joined Division Two of the London League. They finished fourth in their first season, and were promoted to Division One. The following season they won Division One, but were not promoted to the Premier Division. However, despite finishing ninth in 1952–53, they were promoted. After finishing seventh, then third in their first two seasons in the Premier Division, they won the division in 1954–55. In 1957 the club switched to the Delphian League, finishing as runners-up in their first season. When the league folded in 1963 they joined Division Two of the Athenian League. After finishing second in 1968–69, the club was promoted to Division One. They won the Division One title in 1970–71, earning promotion to the Premier Division.\r\n\r\nIn 1973 Aveley joined Division Two of the Isthmian League, which became Division One in 1977. They won the Essex Thameside Trophy in 1979–80 and the Hornchurch Charity Cup in 1982–83. In 1985–86 they finished bottom of the division, and were relegated to Division Two North. After finishing second in 1989–90, a season in which they also became the first club from the bottom division to win the League Cup, the club was promoted back to Division One. Although they finished fourth in their first season back in Division One, the club finished bottom of the division the following season, but were not relegated. However, in 1992–93 they finished bottom again and were relegated to Division Two. In 1994–95 the club were relegated to Division Three, where they remained until 2002, when league reorganisation saw them placed in Division One North.\r\n\r\nAveley were transferred to Division One East of the Southern League in 2004, before returning to Division One North of the Isthmian League in 2006. They won the division in 2008–09, and were promoted to the Premier Division. After finishing third in Isthmian League under manager Rod Stringer, the club lost in the promotion play-off semi-finals to eventual winners Boreham Wood. In 2011–12 the club were relegated back to Division One North after finishing third-from-bottom. In their first season in Division One they finished fifth and qualified for the promotion play-offs. They lost 3–1 to Maldon & Tiptree in the semi-finals.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Beaconsfield Town Football Club is a football club based in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, England. They are currently members of the Southern League Premier Division South and play at Holloways Park.\r\n\r\nThe club was established as Beaconsfield SYCOB in 1994 by a merger of Beaconsfield United of the Spartan League and Slough Youth Club Old Boys of the Chiltonian League, with the new club taking Beaconsfield United's place in the Premier Division of the Spartan League; Beaconsfield United had played in the Spartan League since 1979 and won the Senior Division in 1982–83, earning promotion to the Premier Division, whilst Slough Youth Club Old Boys had been members of the Chiltonian League since 1990. When the league merged with the South Midlands League to form the Spartan South Midlands League in 1997, Beaconsfield were placed in the Premier South Division, finishing as runners-up in the league's first season and earning a place in the Premier Division for the following season.\r\n\r\nIn 2000–01 Beaconsfield won the Premier Division. After repeating this in 2003–04 they were promoted to Division One East of the Southern League. They were transferred to Division One West for the following season, which became Division One South & West for the 2006–07 season. However, after finishing bottom of the division that season, they were relegated back to the Spartan South Midlands League. The club won the league at the first attempt, and were promoted back to Division One South & West of the Southern League. The following season, 2008–09, saw them finish fourth, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. However, they lost 2–1 to AFC Totton in the semi-finals.\r\n\r\nIn 2009 Beaconsfield were transferred to Division One Midlands, which became Division One Central the following season. A fifth-place finish in 2011–12 saw them qualify for the play-offs again, this time losing 3–1 in the final to Bedworth United after beating local rivals Slough Town 2–1 in the semi-finals. Another fifth-place finish the following season led to another play-off campaign, but they were beaten 1–0 by Rugby Town in the semi-finals. In 2017 the club changed its name to Beaconsfield Town, two years after the move was first announced. The 2017–18 season saw them win the renamed East Division, earning promotion to the Premier South division.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Bishop's Stortford Football Club is a football club based in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, England. They are currently members of the Isthmian League Premier Division and play at Woodside Park.\r\n\r\nThe club was established at the Chequers Hotel on 28 January 1874. Initially playing in crimson and green, their first match was played two weeks later, losing 2–1 to East of England Non Conformist Grammar School. In 1885 they were founders of the Hertfordshire County Football Association, and subsequently started playing in local leagues in the 1890s. They joined the Stansted & District League, winning it in 1910–11 and 1912–13, and also entered a team in the Saffron Walden & District League during the same era, winning it in 1911–12, 1912–13 and 1913–14.\r\n\r\nAfter World War I Bishop's Stortford won both the Stansted & District League and the East Hertfordshire League in 1919–20. In 1921 they joined the North-Eastern Division of the Hertfordshire County League. In 1923 the league was reduced to a single division, and it disbanded entirely in 1925, making a brief comeback in 1926–27, when Stortford were one of only six clubs to play in it. In 1929 they joined the new Division Two East of the Spartan League, which they went on to win in 1931–32, earning promotion to Division One.\r\n\r\nFollowing World War II, the league resumed in 1945, with Bishop's Stortford in the Eastern Division. Despite finishing in last place in 1945–46, they were placed in the Premier Division the following season. However, after finishing bottom of the Premier Division in 1948–49, they were relegated to Division One. In 1951 the club were founder members of the Delphian League, which they won in 1954–55. After the league disbanded in 1963 they joined Division Two of the Athenian League, winning Division One in 1965–66 and the Premier Division in 1969–70.\r\n\r\nIn the 1970–71 season Bishop's Stortford reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 6–1 at Reading. In 1971 the club switched to the Isthmian League, and in 1973 they reached the second round of the FA Cup, losing 3–1 at Peterborough United after a replay. They also reached the semi-finals of the FA Amateur Cup, losing 1–0 to Slough Town. However, the following season they won the last ever edition of the cup, beating Ilford 4–1 at Wembley. In 1974–75 they reached the FA Cup first round again, but lost 2–0 at Leatherhead in a replay. The following season they reached the second round again, losing 2–0 at Aldershot.\r\n\r\nIn 1977–78 Bishop's Stortford finished bottom of the Isthmian League Premier Division, and were relegated to Division One. They returned as Division One champions in 1980–81, a season in which they won the FA Trophy with a 1–0 win over Sutton United at Wembley, becoming the first club to win both the FA Amateur Cup and the FA Trophy. In 1982–83 the club beat Football League opposition in the FA Cup for the first time, winning 2–1 at Reading in the first round. After beating Slough Town 4–1 in the second round, they held Second Division Middlesbrough to a 2–2 draw at Ayresome Park, before losing 2–1 at home. They reached the first round again in 1984–85, 1985–86 and 1986–87, but failed to progress on each occasion, with the club losing to Brentford, Peterborough United and Colchester United respectively.\r\n\r\nBishop's Stortford finished bottom of the Premier Division in 1991–92, and were relegated back to Division One. They returned as champions in 1993–94, but were relegated again in 1998–99. After a second-place finish in 2001–02 the club returned to the Premier Division, and after finishing eleventh in 2003–04, were placed in the newly formed Conference South. The 2003–04 season also saw them reach the FA Cup first round again, eventually losing 6–0 at Mansfield Town. In 2006–07 another first round appearance resulted in a 5–3 defeat to King's Lynn. Rushden & Diamonds' expulsion from the Football Conference led to the club being transferred to the Conference North in 2011. In 2012–13 they reached the FA Cup first round for the twelfth time, losing 2–1 at home to Hasting United. At the end of the season they were transferred back to the Conference South, and the following season saw another FA Cup first round appearance, a 2–1 defeat at home to Northampton Town.\r\n\r\nStortford were relegated to the Premier Division of the Southern League at the end of the 2016–17 season after finishing second-from-bottom of the renamed National League South. The club were transferred to the Premier Division of the Isthmian League a year for the 2018–19 season.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Bognor Regis Town Football Club is an English football club based in Bognor Regis, West Sussex. The club is an FA Chartered Standard Community club affiliated to the Sussex County Football Association. They currently compete in the Isthmian League Premier Division.\r\n\r\nBognor F.C. were founded in 1883 and the club became founding members of the West Sussex Football League in 1896, joining the Senior Division. They won the championship of this league for five successive years in the early 1920s, after which they joined the Brighton & Hove District League in 1926. Just one year later, however, they joined the Sussex County League where they were to remain until 1972. The club became Bognor Regis F.C. in 1929 after King George V added the suffix 'Regis' to the seaside resort.\r\n\r\nThe club won the Sussex County Division One championship in the 1948–49 season. At the end of that season, they added \"Town\" to their name so as not to be confused with the local rugby club.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the 1969–70 season they were relegated, but won Division Two at the first attempt. The club won the Division One championship title the following season and were promoted to Division One South of the Southern League. In 1972–73 they reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 6–0 at Colchester United. In 1976 Jack Pearce became manager at the age of just 26, and went on to hold the position until 2007.\r\n\r\nIn 1981 the club were transferred to Division One of the Isthmian League, and were promoted at the end of the 1981–82 season after finishing second. In 1984–85 they reached the first round of the FA Cup again, beating Swansea City 3–1 in a replay after a 1–1 draw at the Vetch Field. In the second round they lost 5–2 at Reading. They reached the second round again the following season, beating Enfield in the first round, before losing 6–1 at Gillingham. They went on to reach the first round again in 1986–87 (losing 1–0 in a replay to Slough Town) and 1987–88 (losing 3–0 at home to Torquay United). In 1988–89 they beat Football League opposition again, defeating Exeter City 2–1, before losing to Cambridge United.\r\n\r\nIn 1991–92 Bognor finished in the relegation zone, but were reprieved after Dagenham and Redbridge Forest merged. However, the following season they finished bottom of the Premier Division, and were relegated to Division One. In 1995–96 they reached the second round of the FA Cup for a fourth time, before losing 4–0 at Peterborough United.\r\n\r\nIn 2002–03 they finished second in Division One South, and were promoted back to the Premier Division. After finishing tenth the following year, the club were placed in the newly established Conference South. They were relegated back to the Isthmian League Premier Division at the end of the 2008–09 season, and were relegated again the following season.\r\n\r\nSeason 2010–11 saw the club compete in the Isthmian League Division One South and they missed out on promotion back to the Premier Division by the tightest of margins. Having finished with a club record total of 96 points, they lost out in the title race to Metropolitan Police on goal difference by just one goal, having led the table by two points, going in to the last fixture. As a result, they found themselves having to participate in the end-of-season play-offs, where they lost at home to Dulwich Hamlet who had finished 31 points behind.\r\n\r\nIn 2011–12 they again finished second in Division One South. They won the end-of-season play-offs, defeating Godalming Town in a thrilling semi-final, before beating Dulwich Hamlet 1–0 in the final, and thus gaining promotion to the Premier Division. The 2013-14 season started slowly with just one point from the opening four matches. However they soon rose up the table, eventually finishing in third place and qualified for the end of season play-offs, although this ended in defeat in the semi-final at home to Lowestoft Town.\r\n\r\nSeason 2015-16 saw them miss out on the Premier Division title by one point and then lose in the play-offs to Dulwich Hamlet. They did however, also enjoy their best ever run in the FA Trophy by reaching the semi-finals. They beat a number of teams from higher divisions along the way, including Bath City, Maidstone United, Altrincham, Sutton United and Torquay United. But hopes of an appearance at Wembley Stadium were dashed when they were defeated in the semi-final by Grimsby Town, losing 1-0 in the first leg at Nyewood Lane, before also losing the second leg 2-1 at Blundell Park (3-1 on aggregate), despite putting up spirited displays in both legs.\r\n\r\nSeason 2016-17 saw them finish in second place for the second season running, but this time they triumphed in the play-offs, beating Wingate & Finchley in the semi-final, before victory over Dulwich Hamlet in the final, to win promotion to the National League South for season 2017-18. However, despite a promising start to life in the Vanarama South in 2017-18, they eventually finished bottom of the table and as a result, returned to the Isthmian Premier for season 2018-19. They spent much of the 2018-19 in play-off contention but a dip in form in the last couple of months saw them eventually finish in 14th place. However, there was something to celebrate at the end of the season as they won the Sussex Senior Cup for the first time in 32 years, defeating Burgess Hill Town in the final played at Falmer Stadium, Brighton.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Brightlingsea Regent Football Club is an English football club based in Brightlingsea, Essex. Formed by a merger of Brightlingsea United and Regent Park Rangers in 2005, they are currently members of the Isthmian League Premier Division and play at North Road.\r\n\r\nBrightlingsea United was founded in 1928 by a merger of Brightlingsea Athletic (originally established as Wesley Guild in 1908, before being reformed in 1921) and Brightlingsea Town (established as Brightlingsea Juniors in 1919). The new club played in Division One the Essex & Suffolk Border League, and in 1929 moved to the North Road ground. They were runners-up in Division One (Junior) in 1929–30, and in 1931 they were promoted to the Premier Division. In 1946–47 they won Division One, and were promoted back to the Premier Division. They were relegated back to Division One in 1954 and returned to the Premier Division as Division One champions in 1961, also jointly winning the Division One Knock-Out Cup following a 1–1 draw with Silver End. However, they were relegated back to Division One after a single season and did not return to the Premier Division until finishing as Division One runners-up in 1968 saw the club promoted. In 1971–72 the club won the League Cup, beating Halstead Town 2–1 in the final.\r\n\r\nIn 1972 they joined the Essex Senior League. They won the title in 1988–89 and 1989–90, before joining the Division One of the Eastern Counties League in 1990. They finished as runners-up in their first season, and were promoted to the Premier Division. However, they returned to Division One after finishing bottom of the Premier Division in 1992–93. The club resigned from the league shortly before the start of the 2002–03 season after the manager and most of the players left, complaining about a lack of proper changing facilities. The first team replaced their reserves in Division Two of the Essex & Suffolk Border League and were relegated to Division Three at the end of the season. When Division Three was disbanded in 2005, the club was moved back to Division Two. That year the club merged with youth club Regent Park Rangers to form Brightlingsea Regent. The newly merged club won Division Two at the first attempt, and were promoted again the following season after finishing second. In 2010–11 the club won the Premier Division and the A.V. Lee Service Memorial Cup, and were promoted to Division One of the Eastern Counties League.\r\n\r\nThe 2012–13 season saw the club finish third in Division One, earning promotion to the Premier Division. They also won the First Division Knock-Out Cup, beating Great Yarmouth Town 1–0 in the final. The following season Brightlingsea finished second in the Premier Division, earning promotion to Division One North of the Isthmian League. The 2016–17 season saw them finish the season as Division One North champions, earning promotion to the Premier Division.",

The new club joined the Spartan League in 1919, which the Generals had been members of prior to World War I. They won back-to-back league titles in 1921–22 and 1922–23, and were champions again in 1924–25. League reorganisation in 1928 saw them placed in Division One West. However, the following season saw them placed in the Premier Division after further reorganisation, and they were league runners-up in 1929–30, before going on to win the league in 1932–33. During World War II they played in the Great Western Combination.",

The club was formed in 1992 through a merger between Redbridge Forest and Dagenham. The team currently plays in Football League Two, the fourth tier in the English football league system.\r\n\r\nThe club's traditional colours are red and blue, to represent the merger teams' colours. In the early days the club used red for the home shirt and blue for the away shirts, normally red and white vertical stripes for the home and blue and white vertical stripes for the away. In recent times the kit has gone under a large transformation. The stripes have been replaced with solid colours. Currently, the home kit includes the traditional red and blue, while the new away kit is mostly yellow and black.",

They are members of the National League North, the sixth tier of English football, and play at Blackwell Meadows.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1883, and played its matches at Feethams. The club originally played in regionally organised leagues, and were one of the founding members of the Northern League in 1889. They were first admitted to the Football League when the Third Division North was formed in 1921. They won the Third Division North title in 1925, and their 15th place in the Second Division in 1926 remains their highest ever league finish. After their admission to the League, they spent most of their history in the bottom tier. They won the Third Division North Cup in 1934, their first victory in nationally organised cup competition. They reached the last 16 of the FA Cup twice, and the quarter-final of the Football League Cup once, in 1968. In the early 1990s they won successive titles, in the Conference National in 1990 and the Fourth Division in 1991. In 2011 they won the FA Trophy, defeating Mansfield Town 1–0 at Wembley Stadium.\r\n\r\nDarlington moved to the all-seater, 25,000-capacity Darlington Arena in 2003. The cost of the stadium was a major factor in driving the club into administration in 2012. Because the club was unable to agree a Creditors Voluntary Agreement (CVA) it was expelled from the Football Association (FA). A new club was immediately formed but the FA ruled that, as a new club, it must have a different playing name from the expelled club. The name chosen was Darlington 1883, and that club was placed in the Northern League Division One, the ninth tier of English football, for the 2012–13 season. They won three promotions in four seasons before the FA approved their request to change to the traditional Darlington FC name.\r\n\r\nThe club's traditional colours are black and white shirts, black shorts and black and white socks. The club's crest depicts Locomotion No. 1, referring to the town's railway history; as well as a stylised Quaker hat, referring to the religious movement that had a historic influence on the town, and which was the source of the team's nickname, the Quakers.\r\n\r\nThe club's main rival historically has been Hartlepool United.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Dover Athletic Football Club is an association football club based in the town of Dover, Kent, England. The club currently competes in the National League, the fifth tier of English football. The club was formed in 1983 after the dissolution of the town's previous club, Dover F.C., whose place in the Southern League was taken by the new club. In the 1989–90 season Dover Athletic won the Southern League championship, but failed to gain promotion to the Football Conference as the club's ground did not meet the required standard. Three seasons later the team won the title again and this time gained promotion to the Conference, where they spent nine seasons before being relegated at the end of the 2001–02 season. The club was transferred from the Southern League to the Isthmian League in 2004, competing in that league's Premier Division for one season before mounting financial problems led the club to a further relegation. In the 2007–08 season, Dover won Division One South of the league, before winning the Premier Division in 2008–09 and thus gaining promotion to the Conference South. They spent five seasons in this division, reaching the play-offs three times, before defeating Ebbsfleet United in the 2013–14 play-off final to finally return to the Conference Premier after a twelve-year absence.\r\n\r\nThe team usually wear white shirts and are consequently nicknamed the Whites. They have played at the Crabble Athletic Ground since the club's formation. The club's best performance in the FA Cup was reaching the third round proper in both the 2010–11 and 2014–15 seasons, while the best performance registered in the FA Trophy, the national competition for higher-level non-league clubs, was a run to the semi-finals in the 1997–98 season.",

Traditionally based in Enfield, Greater London, the club was, between the 1960s and 1980s, one of the most successful non-league clubs in England, winning the FA Amateur Cup, FA Trophy and Football Conference twice. The club, however, did not manage to gain election to the Football League. Following financial struggles and the sale of their Southbury Road stadium, the club declined, eventually folding and reforming in 2007 as Enfield 1893 F.C., later dropping the 1893 suffix in 2019.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Enfield Town Football Club is a football club based in Enfield Town, Greater London, England. Established in 2001 as a fan-led breakaway from Enfield, the club are currently members of the Isthmian League Premier Division and play at the Queen Elizabeth II Stadium. The club badge features the Enfield beast.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded on 23 June 2001 by the Enfield Supporters' Trust after Trust members considered that the regime in charge of Enfield no longer had the interests of the club at heart and lacked sufficient will to bring about the return of the club to its home town, having left Southbury Road in 1999. This followed the chairman of Enfield withdrawing from an outline agreement with the Supporters' Trust which would have seen the Trust take over the running of a debt-free club and receiving £100,000 from money from the sale of Southbury Road which was held in an escrow account by Enfield Council. The balance of over £600,000 would have been paid to the chairman.\r\n\r\nThe newly formed club were admitted to the Essex Senior League for the 2001–02 season, three divisions below the Isthmian League Premier Division where Enfield continued to play. The club's first season saw them finish second in the league and win the League Cup, the Capital Counties Feeder Leagues Trophy, and the Middlesex Senior Charity Cup. The following season they won the Essex Senior League, but were not promoted due to ground grading issues. Despite only finishing fourth in the 2003–04 season, in May 2004 the Isthmian League invited the club to join Division Two, but later rescinded the offer. They won the Essex Senior League for a second time in 2004–05, and were promoted to Division One East of the Southern League, which Enfield were also members of. They finished third in their first season in the Southern League, qualifying for the play-offs, where they were beaten 3–1 after extra time in the semi-finals by Wivenhoe Town.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2006 the club were transferred to Division One North of the Isthmian League. The 2006–07 season saw them finish third again, but they lost 4–2 to AFC Sudbury in the play-off semi-finals. At the end of the season Enfield were liquidated and Enfield Town chairman Paul Millington released a statement suggesting that the two clubs should merge and \"return the name of Enfield to the top of the non-league world\". However, the Enfield players, officials and supporters rejected the offer and formed a brand new club named Enfield 1893. Enfield Town qualified for the play-offs again in 2009–10 after finishing fourth. However, after beating Wingate & Finchley 3–2 in the semi-finals, they lost 3–1 in the final to Concord Rangers. In 2011–12 they were runners-up in the division and went on to win the play-offs with a 1–0 win over Needham Market in the final, earning promotion to the Premier Division.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the 2012–13 season the club won the Supporters Direct Cup, defeating Wrexham 3–1. They retained it the following season, beating YB SK Beveren of Belgium 8-2. In 2016–17 they finished fourth in the Isthmian League Premier Division before losing 4–2 to Dulwich Hamlet in the play-off semi-finals. The 2018–19 season saw the club win the Isthmian League's League Cup, beating AFC Hornchurch 2–0 in the final.",

The team competes in League Two, the fourth tier of English football, and have played their home games at the New Lawn since 2006, when they moved from their original home at The Lawn Ground.\r\n\r\nFormed in October 1889, the club became founder members of the Mid Gloucestershire League five years later. Competing in various local league competitions for much of the 20th century, they won a multitude of league titles: the Dursley & District League (1902–03), the Stroud & District League (1911–12 and 1920–21), the Stroud Premier League (1934–35, 1935–36 and 1936–37), the North Gloucestershire League (1920–21 and 1921–22), and the Gloucestershire Northern Senior League (1937–38, 1949–50 and 1950–51). They became founder members of the Gloucestershire County League in 1968, before they were moved up to the Premier Division of the Hellenic League seven years later.\r\n\r\nForest Green won the Hellenic League in the 1981–82 season and lifted the FA Vase after beating Rainworth Miners Welfare in the final at Wembley. They spent the next 13 years in the Midland Division of the Southern League, and briefly competed under the name Stroud F.C. Reverting to the name Forest Green Rovers, the club won successive Southern League Southern Division and Premier Division titles in 1996–97 and 1997–98, winning promotion into the Conference. Reaching the 1999 FA Trophy Final, which they lost, they became the first club to reach the finals of both the FA Vase and FA Trophy. They also reached the 2001 FA Trophy Final, which again they lost. Twice reprieved from relegation from the Conference National due to the demotion of other clubs, the club was transformed following investment from green energy industrialist Dale Vince in 2010.\r\n\r\nUnder Dale Vince's chairmanship Forest Green became the world's first vegan football club in 2015, and the New Lawn was installed with numerous eco-friendly innovations. Investment in the playing squad saw the club compete for promotion into the English Football League, which they achieved with victory in the 2017 National League play-offs, having been beaten in the semi-finals in 2015 and in the 2016 final.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Gateshead Football Club is a professional association football club based in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England. The club participates in the National League, the fifth tier of English football. Their most recent notable events include a visit to Wembley, in the play-off final in 2013\/14, and reaching the FA Cup 3rd round in 2014\/2015. The club is very popular among Newcastle United fans and Sunderland fans alike, but also have their own specific fan base famously calling themselves the 'Heed Army'.\r\n\r\nAlthough the club was formed in 1977, it can trace its roots back to 1889. Then, South Shields Adeleide, located eight miles (14 km) from Gateshead, were formed. They originally played in the Northern Alliance before joining the North Eastern Leagues and changing name to just South Shields. They joined the extended Football League Second Division in 1919–20. The mid-to-late 1920s saw the club struggling financially before in 1928 the club finished bottom and were relegated to the Third Division (North). After two unsuccessful seasons in the lower division, the struggling club took the step of not just leaving the Horsley Hill ground but of moving the club to another town in search of more support. Newcastle upon Tyne, was mentioned as a possible destination, but Gateshead was eventually chosen, mainly due to the enthusiastic support of the Gateshead Council.\r\n\r\nThe 'new' club, Gateshead A.F.C., stayed in the Football League until 1960 when they failed to win re-election after finishing in the bottom three of Division Four. They played in various regional leagues before becoming founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968, staying for just two seasons before finishing bottom and again failing to win re-election. They joined the Midland League in 1971 but in August 1973 the club ran into financial problems and were liquidated.\r\n\r\nIn 1974, history repeated itself. A second South Shields FC, formed in 1936, after the previous incarnation had made the afore-mentioned move, also made the move to Gateshead, becoming Gateshead United. United however were not around for too long, being wound up in 1977.\r\n\r\nIn 1977, a new club was formed – Gateshead F.C.. The club were immediately accepted into the Northern Premier League. By this time, their home ground, the Gateshead Youth Stadium, had been upgraded and renamed as Gateshead International Stadium with facilities good enough for a higher grade of football.\r\n\r\nAfter six years Gateshead won promotion from the Northern Premier League to the Alliance Premier League in 1983, with a record tally of points and goals scored. With a relatively lucrative sponsorship, Gateshead spent several seasons in the Football Conference. However, the sponsorship money dried up, and the club started to decline, spending the 2003–04 season in the Northern Premier League First Division. A 6th-place finish was enough to gain promotion to the Premier Division due to the restructuring of the National League System.\r\n\r\nA new board was appointed under the Chairmanship of Graham Wood, which saw Gateshead regain its momentum with the appointment of Ian Bogie as manager. On 3 May 2008, Gateshead beat Buxton 2–0 in the Northern Premier League Premier Division Play-Off Final and were, therefore, promoted to the recently formed Conference North.\r\n\r\nGateshead F.C. absorbed local club Low Fell Juniors to form Gateshead Juniors from the start of the 2008\/09 season, expanding the number of teams under the club banner.\r\n\r\nGateshead finished the 2008–09 season in the Conference North in second (2nd) place. They qualified for the play-offs along with Alfreton Town, Telford United and their semi-final opponents Southport. Gateshead beat Southport 2–1 on aggregate and won the Play-Off Final 1–0 against Telford, earning promotion back to the Conference Premier where they remain.\r\n\r\nGateshead announced on 13 October 2009 that they would be moving to a full-time employed playing squad for the beginning of the 2010–2011 season.\r\n\r\nOn 10 December 2012, manager Ian Bogie and assistant Terry Mitchell were relieved of their duties at the club. Reserve team manager Anth Smith named caretaker manager. Three days later, Smith was named permanent manager and given a contract until the end of the 2012–13 season. On 18 August 2013, David Rush, Smith's assistant, was named as caretaker manager after his resignation, before former York City manager Gary Mills was appointed on 3 September 2013. Mills took Gateshead to third place in the Conference at the end of his first season as manager, qualifying the team for the end-of-season promotion play-offs. An aggregate win over Grimsby Town took Gateshead to their first appearance at Wembley Stadium. However, on 18 May 2014, they lost 2–1 to Cambridge United, who were promoted back into the Football League after a nine-season absence. Gateshead are currently focusing on getting into the Football League.",

The club have moved back to the National League North for the 2019\/20 season. Previously it competed in the National League North from 2009 to 2017 and then spent two seasons in the National League South afterwards. Prior to that, it spent a record 70 years within the Southern Football League from 1939 until 2009. The club secured promotion after a playoff final win against Farnborough.\r\n\r\nIn July 2007, the club was considerably affected by the 2007 United Kingdom floods, which significantly affected Gloucestershire. and left the Meadow Park stadium under eight feet of water. The impact of the flooding has meant that the club has been in exile away from Gloucester ever since. The Tigers have played home games at Cheltenham Town's Whaddon Road, after spending three seasons sharing at Cirencester Town's Corinium Stadium and Forest Green Rovers' New Lawn stadium in Nailsworth. From the 2017–18 season, the club has played at Evesham United whilst construction continues on a new stadium on the old Meadow Park site.\r\n\r\nThe club received full planning permission from Gloucester City Council to build a new 3,060 capacity stadium, raised by several feet, on the site of their former home of Meadow Park with plans to expand to over 4,000. A revised plan was submitted in October 2018 however to retain the use of a former building and some alterations to the layout. This was approved by Gloucester City Council on 7 May.\r\n\r\nThe club is currently managed by James Rowe, who has been manager since November 2019. The club is affiliated to the Gloucestershire County FA.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Grimsby Town Football Club is a professional football club based in Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, England, that competes in League Two, the fourth tier of the English football league system. Nicknamed \"the Mariners\", the club was founded as Grimsby Pelham Football Club in 1878, changed its name to Grimsby Town a year later, and moved to its current stadium, Blundell Park, in 1898.\r\n\r\nGrimsby Town were the most successful pre-war team of the three professional clubs in historic Lincolnshire, being the only one to play top-flight English football. It is also the only club of the three to reach an FA Cup semi-final (doing so on two occasions, both times during the 1930's). It has also spent more time in the English game's first and second tiers than any other club from Lincolnshire. Notable former managers include Bill Shankly, who went on to guide Liverpool to three League titles, two FA Cups and a UEFA Cup triumph, and Lawrie McMenemy who, after securing promotion to the then Third Division in 1972, moved to Southampton where he won the FA Cup in 1976. Alan Buckley is the club's most successful manager; he had three spells between 1988 and 2008, guiding the club to three promotions and two appearances at Wembley Stadium during the 1997–98 season, winning both the Football League Trophy and the Football League Second Division play-off Final. In 2008 Buckley took Grimsby to the capital again, but lost out to MK Dons in the final of the Football League Trophy. The Mariners had also reached the Football League Two play-off Final in 2006 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, but lost the match 1–0 to Cheltenham Town, Later trips to Wembley in 2013 and 2016 saw them defeated in the FA Trophy final by Wrexham and F.C. Halifax Town respectively, having also lost at the venue in the 2015 National League play-off final to Bristol Rovers before finally gaining promotion by winning the 2016 final against Forest Green Rovers. In 2021, relegation to the National League was confirmed for a second time, following a 3-2 defeat at Exeter City.\r\n\r\nGrimsby Town's relegation in 2010 made them the fourth club to compete in all top five divisions of English football (after Carlisle United, Oxford United and Luton Town, and before Leyton Orient and Notts County). Grimsby's 1939 FA Cup semi-final attendance of 76,962 versus Wolverhampton Wanderers is still a record at Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium. In 1954 they became the first English club to appoint a foreign manager, Hungarian Elemér Berkessy. The club's record appearance holder is John McDermott, who made 754 appearances between 1987 and 2007, while their leading scorer is Pat Glover, with 180 goals (1930–39).",

The club participates in the National League, the fifth tier of English football. They replaced Halifax Town A.F.C., which went into administration in the 2007–08 season.\r\n\r\nHuge tax debts buried Halifax Town A.F.C. after almost 100 years as a football club. New figures put to a reconvened creditors meeting in May 2008 showed the cash-strapped Shaymen owed over £800,000 to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. The Revenue refused any deal and that effectively finished the club – already over £2 million in the red. Administrators had been trying to broker a rescue package but speaking after five hours of talks that left liquidation near inevitable, administrator Rob Sadler said: \"Halifax Town will probably perish.\" It was originally thought the club owed the taxman around £500,000, which might have left scope for a deal. But the news that it owed £814,000 meant that even if all the other creditors had accepted the 2.5p-in-the-pound offer originally on the table it would not have been enough.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Football Association, discussing the makeup of the football pyramid for the 2008–09 season, FC Halifax Town were not placed in either the Conference Premier, the Conference North or the Northern Premier League Premier Division. Halifax appealed against the decision to remove them from the Football Conference. Though the appeal was rejected on 11 June, the hope was that Halifax could play in the NPL Premier Division. This did not materialise, and eventually Halifax Town were accepted to play in the Northern Premier League Division One North in the new season under the new name F.C. Halifax Town.",

Formed in 1973 by a merger of Edmonton and Wood Green Town, they are currently members of the Isthmian League Premier Division and play at Coles Park.\r\n\r\nThe club was established in 1973 by a merger of Edmonton and Haringey Borough (formerly Wood Green Town), and was initially named Edmonton & Haringey. The new club took Edmonton's place in Division One of the Athenian League, and adopted their current name after finishing bottom of the division in 1975–76. The league was reduced to a single division in 1977 and the club finished bottom of the league in 1981–82.\r\n\r\nWhen the Athenian League was disbanded at the end of the 1983–84 season, Haringey joined Division Two North of the Isthmian League. With many of the players and the management team leaving shortly before the start of the 1988–89 season, the club dropped out of the league, before joining the Premier Division of the Spartan League for the 1989–90 season. In 1990–91 the club won the London Senior Cup. In 1995 they were renamed Tufnell Park, taking the name of one of the clubs that had merged to form Edmonton, but reverted to the Haringey Borough name the following year. When the Spartan League merged with the South Midlands League in 1997 to form the Spartan South Midlands League, the club were placed in Premier Division South for the 1997–98 season; a seventh-place finish saw them placed in the Premier Division for the following season.\r\n\r\nHaringey were relegated to Division One at the end of the 2006–07 season, which had seen them finish bottom of the Premier Division. However, they were Division One runners-up the following season, earning an immediate promotion back to the Premier Division; the season also saw them win the Division One Cup. In 2011–12 the club won the league's Challenge Trophy. At the end of the season they were transferred to the Essex Senior League, where their Coles Park tenants Greenhouse London also played. The 2014–15 season saw the club win the Essex Senior League, earning promotion to Division One North of the Isthmian League.\r\n\r\nIn 2016–17 Haringey finished fifth in Division One North, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. However, they lost 5–4 to Maldon & Tiptree in the semi-finals. The club finished fourth in the division the following season, and after beating Heybridge Swifts 2–0 in the semi-finals, they won the final 3–1 against Canvey Island to secure promotion to the Premier Division. The 2018–19 season saw the club reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, going on to lose 1–0 at home to AFC Wimbledon. In October 2019, the Haringey players left the pitch during an FA Cup fourth qualifying round game against Yeovil Town after the Haringey goalkeeper, Valery Pajetat, was reportedly spat at and hit by an object thrown from the Yeovil Town end. The Metropolitan Police announced their intention to investigate the incident.",

Until 2007 their main local rivals were Darlington F.C., but that club entered into administration in 2012, and the local rival is now considered to be York City F.C..\r\n\r\nHartlepool is known for its association with Brian Clough who began his managerial career at the club in 1965 and is widely considered to be one of the greatest English football managers of all time. Under Cyril Knowles' management the club won promotion to the Third Division in 1990. Hartlepool's greatest moment occurred in 2005 when they narrowly missed promotion to The Championship.\r\n\r\nThe club has received media attention in recent years when the team mascot \"H'Angus the Monkey\" was elected mayor during the 2002 Hartlepool Council election.

            "strDescriptionEN": "Hendon Football Club is a semi-professional football club based in Kingsbury in the London Borough of Brent. They are currently members of the Southern League Premier Division South and play at Silver Jubilee Park in Kingsbury.\r\n\r\nThe club was established as Christchurch Hampstead in 1908. They joined the Third Division of the Finchley & District League, which they won at the first attempt, earning promotion to Division Two. At the start of the 1909–10 season the club were renamed Hampstead Town and they went on to win Division Two at the first attempt, earning promotion to Division One. For the 1911–12 season the club entered teams into both Division One of the Finchley & District League and Division Two of the London League. They won the Finchley & District League title, and a fourth-place finish in Division Two of the London League saw the club promoted to Division One. They subsequently entered a team into the Middlesex League alongside the London League team.\r\n\r\nIn 1912–13 Hampstead Town were runners-up in Division One of the London League, earning promotion to the Premier Division (Amateur); they also won the Middlesex League. The following season saw them win both the Middlesex League and the Premier Division (Amateur) of the London League. This success saw the club admitted to the Athenian League for the 1914–15 season. However, the league was abandoned after two games due to World War I. After the war they played in the United Senior League in the 1918–19 season and won the league, before returning to the Athenian League when it restarted in 1919. The club was renamed Hampstead in 1926. They were Athenian League runners-up in 1928–29 and again in 1932–33, before being renamed Golders Green in 1933. They reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time in 1934–35, losing 10–1 at Third Division South Southend United. In 1946 the club was renamed again, adopting its current name, that of a club that existed in the 19th century.\r\n\r\nHendon were Athenian League runners-up in 1947–48, 1948–49 and 1951–52 before winning their first Athenian League title in 1952–53, a season which also saw them reach the first round of the FA Cup again, losing 2–0 at Northampton Town in a replay. In 1954–55 they reached the final of the FA Amateur Cup, losing 2–0 to Bishop Auckland at Wembley. They went on to win the Athenian League title again in 1955–56, also reaching the second round of the FA Cup, beating Halesowen Town 4–2 in the first round before losing 6–2 at Exeter City in the second. The club won their first Amateur Cup in 1959–60, defeating Kingstonian 2–1 in the final. A third Athenian League title was won in 1960–61. In 1963 the club switched to the Isthmian League. They were runners-up in their first season in the league. In their second season, 1964–65, the club won the Isthmian League and Amateur Cup double, defeating Whitby Town 3–1 in the final.\r\n\r\nHendon reached the final of the FA Amateur Cup again the following season, but lost 3–1 to Wealdstone. After winning their third Amateur Cup with a 2–0 win against Enfield in 1971–72, a second Isthmian League title was won in 1972–73. The following season they reached the third round of the FA Cup, where they drew Newcastle United; after holding them to a 1–1 draw at St James' Park, Hendon lost 4–0 in a replay played at Watford's Vicarage Road. In 1975–76 the club defeated a Football League club for the first time, beating Reading 1–0 in the first round, before losing to Swindon Town in the second round.\r\n\r\nIn 2003–04 Hendon finished fourth in the Isthmian League Premier Division but declined to join the new Conference South. Having remained in the top division of the Isthmian League since joining it in 1963, Hendon finished in the relegation zone at the end of the 2005–06 season, but were reprieved after Canvey Island's resignation from the Football Conference. During the summer of 2010, the club was bought out by the Hendon FC Supporters Trust, an Industrial and Provident Society. In 2014–15 they were Premier Division runners-up, qualifying for the promotion play-offs; after beating Metropolitan Police 2–1 in the semi-finals, they lost the final 1–0 to Margate. The 2017–18 season saw the club finish third in the Premier Division. In the subsequent play-offs, they defeated Folkestone Invicta 4–0 in the semi-finals before losing the final 4–3 on penalties to Dulwich Hamlet. The club were placed in the Premier South Division of the Southern League for the 2018–19 season as part of the restructuring of the non-League pyramid.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Hornchurch Football Club is a football club based in Hornchurch, Greater London, England. They are currently members of the Isthmian League Premier Division and play at the Hornchurch Stadium.\r\n\r\nThe original club was established in 1923 as Upminster Wanderers. They joined the Romford League, which they remained members of until moving up to Division Two East of the Spartan League in 1938, at which point the club adopted the name Upminster Football Club. After spending the 1945–46 season back in the Romford League, winning the league title and the Essex Junior Cup, the club returned to the lower divisions of the Spartan League the following season. The club were promoted to the Premier Division of the league in 1950–51, but left to join the Delphian League in 1952, at which point another name change (this time due to a move to the Hornchurch Stadium) saw them become Hornchurch & Upminster.\r\n\r\nHornchurch & Upminster were Delphian League runners-up in 1958–59, after which the club transferred to the Athenian League. In 1961 they were renamed Hornchurch Football Club. The Athenian League was expanded in 1963, with Hornchurch becoming members of the Premier Division. They were relegated to Division One after finishing bottom of the Premier Division in 1965–66, but won the Division One title the following season to make an immediate return to the Premier Division. The yo-yoing between divisions continued as they were relegated again in 1967–68, promoted from Division One after finishing third in 1970–71, and then relegated again at the end of the 1972–73 season.\r\n\r\nIn 1975 Hornchurch transferred to Division Two of the Isthmian League, which was renamed Division One in 1977. The club were relegated to Division Two at the end of the 1977–78 season saw them relegated to Division Two. In 1980–81 they were Division Two runners-up, earning promotion to Division One. League restructuring led to the club being placed in Division Two North for the 1986–87 season, before another reorganisation in 1991 saw them moved to Division Three. In 2001–02 the club were Division Three runners-up and were promoted to Division One.\r\n\r\nHornchurch went on to finish as runners-up in Division One North in 2002–03 and were promoted to the Premier Division. The 2003–04 season saw the club reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time. After beating Third Division Darlington 2–0 in the first round, they lost 1–0 to Tranmere Rovers in the second. A fifth-place finish in the Premier Division that season (despite a 10-point deduction for going into administration) was also enough for the club to earn a place in the new Conference South. Their first season in the Conference South saw them reach the FA Cup first round again. However, shortly before the match the entire squad was released due to financial problems. With several debutants and youth players, the team lost the match against Boston United 5–2, and subsequently folded the season, the club folded.\r\n\r\nThe club was quickly reformed under the name AFC Hornchurch, and were placed in the Essex Senior League (three levels below the Conference South) by the Football Association on 19 May. In their first season they won the league, as well as the League Cup and the Gordon Brasted Memorial Trophy. Promoted to Division One North of the Isthmian League, the club won that division in 2006–07 to earn promotion to the Premier Division. In 2007–08 AFC Hornchurch finished fourth in the Premier Division, qualifying for the promotion play-offs, in which they were beaten 3–1 by AFC Wimbledon in the semi-finals. The 2008–09 saw the club finish sixth, missing out on the play-offs. They also reached the first round of the FA Cup, losing 1–0 at home to Peterborough United. Although they entered administration in May 2009, the club managed to survive. After a ninth-placed finish in 2009–10 and coming tenth in 2010–11, they were runners-up in 2011–12, qualifying for the play-offs. Following a 3–1 win over Bury Town in the semi-finals, they defeated Lowestoft Town 2–1 in the final, earning promotion to the Conference South.\r\n\r\nTheir first season in the Conference South saw AFC Hornchurch finish 20th, resulting in relegation back to the Isthmian League Premier Division. The 2013–14 resulted in a fifth-placed finish and qualification for the promotion play-offs. In a repeat of the 2011 final, they faced Lowestoft Town following a 1–0 win over Kingstonian in the semi-finals. On this occasion, they lost 3–0 to the Suffolk club. The following season saw them finish 23rd out of 24 clubs in the Premier Division and relegation to Division One North. They finished fifth in 2015–16, again qualifying for the promotion play-offs. After beating Thurrock 2–0 in the semi-final, they were beaten 3–1 by Harlow Town. In 2016–17 a fourth-place finish led to another playoff campaign, with the club losing 1–0 to Thurrock in the semi-finals.\r\n\r\nAFC Hornchurch were champions of the renamed North Division in 2017–18, earning promotion back to the Premier Division. At the end of the following season they were renamed Hornchurch Football Club.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Horsham Football Club are a non-League football club based in Horsham, West Sussex, England, currently playing in the Isthmian League Premier Division.\r\n\r\nThe first Horsham Football Club was founded in 1871, though its existence largely depended upon enough players being available to form a side. In 1881 the club was firmly re-established, playing its first game against Dorking, and, in September 1882, helped found the Sussex County Football Association, with club official A. R. Bostock becoming one of three original Vice Presidents. Horsham became founder members of the West Sussex Football League in 1896. They went on to win the West Sussex League championship in 1899-00, 1900–01 and 1901–02, and claiming the Royal Irish Rifles Cup in 1900 by defeating the champions of the East Sussex Senior League, Hastings. After having played at both Hurst Park and Springfield Park, the club secured Queen Street as its permanent home in 1904, but some lean form over the ensuing years saw Horsham overlooked when the Sussex County League was created in 1920. The club eventually became members of that competition after winning the West Sussex Senior League for the fourth time in 1925–26.\r\n\r\nThis was a golden age for the club and the County League was won in 1932, 1933, 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938, with the team regularly scoring over one hundred goals a season. The Sussex RUR Cup was taken in 1931, 1932, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938, and the Sussex Senior Cup in 1934 and 1939. After the break brought on by hostilities, Horsham won the first post-war title in 1947, the RUR Cup in 1946, 1949 and 1951, and the Sussex Senior Cup in 1950.\r\n\r\nIn 1947–48 Horsham reached the First Round Proper of the FA Cup for the first time, taking a first-minute lead against Tommy Lawton's Notts County, before losing 9–1. For many years Horsham had been looking to test themselves at a higher level but had seentheir annual applications to join the Athenian League come to nothing. In 1951 the club changed tack and successfully applied to become members of the Metropolitan League where they were champions at the first attempt. In 1957, however, after finishing bottom of the table, they stepped down to the Corinthian League. In 1963 this league was disbanded, and Horsham were finally able to join the Athenian League.\r\n\r\nIn 1966 they reached the First Round proper of the FA Cup for a second time after defeating Hastings United 2–1 in the 4th Qualifying Round. Horsham played Swindon Town in front of a crowd of 7,134 at Queen Street. Although they lost 0–3, the day was a 'red letter day' for the club. A special temporary stand was erected at the Queen St end of the ground for the match.\r\n\r\nIn 1973, Horsham joined the Isthmian League when it expanded to two divisions. They enjoyed little success during the 1980s and early 1990s, finishing bottom of the entire league in 1993–94, but began to turn their fortunes around with a Division Three championship win in 1995–96. In 2001–02 they finished second in Division Two and were promoted to Division One South and in 2005–06 a second-place finish in that division, finishing 2nd behind champions Ramsgate on goal difference, saw them promoted to the Premier Division for the first time. That same season, Horsham reached the final of the Sussex Senior Cup for the first time since 1979, but were beaten by Lewes 3–1 after extra-time.\r\n\r\nTheir first ever season in the Premier Division, in 2006–07, saw the Hornets finish in eighth and a promotion challenge in 2007–08 again fell away to see the club end up eleventh. However, the team beat Maidenhead United 4–1 to reach the Second Round Proper of the FA Cup for the first time where two matches were played against eventual League One champions, Swansea City.\r\n\r\nHaving sold their ground for redevelopment at the end of the season, Horsham played at Worthing during 2008–09 and reached the 4th Qualifying Round of the FA Cup where they took Conference side Stevenage Borough to a replay before ending an injury-ravaged year in thirteenth place. Season 2009–10 found the club back in Horsham, having entered into a groundshare agreement with their old neighbours Horsham YMCA as their quest for a new ground continued. Financial cutbacks at the end of the 2010–11 campaign, during which they finished only 6 points clear of possible relegation back to Division One, saw Horsham part company with long serving manager John Maggs after 11 years in charge. Former Faversham Town manager, Justin Luchford, was appointed as his replacement in June 2011 but left the role in late October 2011 and was replaced by assistant, Hugo Langton. A lack of improvement in results, during which the club failed to win any of their 19 league games, saw Langton replaced by former Worthing boss Simon Colbran in March 2012 but he was unable to prevent the side from returning to Division One South. A season of stability followed, with the Hornets ending the campaign in fifteenth and claiming the Brighton Charity Cup for a second successive season but Colbran resigned his post in November 2013 with the club in 18th position. His departure led to the popular appointment of Horsham born Gary Charman, some fifteen years after making the first of more than 550 appearances for his hometown club. Charman steered the club to 16th place but a poor run of results the following season led to him being replaced by two more former players, Anthony Storey and Cliff Cant, in January 2015. Despite some impressive initial results, the pair were unable to save the club from relegation so former East Preston manager Dominic di Paola was appointed towards the end of the campaign with a view to rebuilding a side capable of competing in the Sussex County League for the first time since 1951.\r\n\r\nAfter a season-long battle with Eastbourne Town, Horsham took the title by eleven points to secure a record-equalling eighth County League title, thus securing an immediate return to the Isthmian League. During that 2015\/16 campaign, the club recorded a club record ninety-seven points whilst conceding the fewest goals in their history (twenty-two). After a slow start to the 2016\/17 campaign, in which just three of the first thirteen matches were won, the Hornets recovered to finish in a not unsatisfactory sixteenth place in Division One South. Off the pitch the club finally got the news it longed for when, on March 21st 2017, a revised ground application was submitted and overwhelmingly approved by HDC, meaning work could finally begin on constructing a new community stadium off the Worthing Road.\r\n\r\nWith the arrangement at YMCA having come to an end, Horsham moved into the Sussex FA Headquarters at Lancing's Culver Road in the summer of 2017 but a crippling injury list put paid to any pre-season expectations of improving the club's position, with the low point of the season coming in an 8-0 reverse at Cray Wanderers in what is the club's heaviest ever FA Trophy defeat. Yet that result proved the catalyst for the side to kick on and only six of the next nineteen matches ended in defeat, a run that lifted Horsham to eleventh in the table, only to fall away again in the closing months of the season before ending in fifteenth spot, one better than the previous year.\r\n\r\nHopes that the club might start the 2018–19 campaign in the new ground went unfulfilled but the disappointment did not seem to affect the players who turned Culver Road into something of a fortress, losing just four matches in all competitions - two of them to higher-league opponents Bath City and Eastbourne Borough. Overdue runs to the latter stages of the qualifying rounds in both the FA Cup and FA Trophy bred confidence that was transferred into their league form and, from early December, the Hornets never dropped below fourth place, finally finishing as runners-up to Cray Wanderers. With automatic promotion the right of only the champions, Horsham faced a play-off semi-final clash with Haywards Heath Town - the only side to have recorded a league double over them during the campaign - and duly won 3-0 to set up a home final with Ashford United. After a tense tie, played in front of over eight hundred spectators, Horsham won through 2-1 after extra-time to return to the Premier Division after an absence of seven years.\r\n\r\nThe death of President Frank King in May 2019 meant that he tragically missed seeing his beloved Hornets finally take ownership of its new ground, just a few weeks after his death. His name, however, will live on through the decision to dedicate the club's new boardroom in his memory.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Lewes Football Club is a football club based in Lewes, East Sussex, England. They are currently members of the Isthmian League Premier Division and play at the Dripping Pan.\r\n\r\nThe club was established in a meeting at the Royal Oak pub on 23 September 1885. In 1896 they were founder members of the East Sussex League. The club finished bottom of the league in 1898–99 and again the following season. The league was expanded to two divisions in 1899, with Lewes placed in the Senior Division, going on to finish last for a third consecutive season. After finishing bottom of the Senior Division again in 1900–01 without winning a match, the club left the league. They later joined the Mid-Sussex League, entering its Senior Division in 1905. The club were Senior Division runners-up in 1907–08 and again in 1909–10 before winning the league in 1910–11.\r\n\r\nLewes then left the Mid-Sussex League for a reformed East Sussex League, and were runners-up in 1912–13. Although they finished bottom of the East Sussex League the following season, the club also played in the Mid-Sussex League and won the league title. After World War I they spent the 1919–20 season in the Brighton, Hove & District League. In 1920 they were founder members of the Sussex County League. The club were runners-up in 1924–25 and again in 1933–34 and 1958–59, also winning the League Cup in 1938–39.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing as runners-up in 1963–64, Lewes won the Sussex County League title the following season and moved up to Division Two of the Athenian League. They were Division Two champions in 1967–68, earning promotion to Division One. After a third-place finish in their first season in Division One, the club won the division the following season (on goal average) and were promoted to the Premier Division. In 1977 they transferred to Division Two of the Isthmian League, in which they finished as runners-up in 1979–80 to earn promotion to Division One.\r\n\r\nLewes remained in Division One of the Isthmian League until being relegated to Division Two at the end of the 1990–91 season. Although they were promoted back to Division One the following season after finishing as runners-up in Division Two, they were relegated again in 1992–93 and again in 1993–94, dropping into Division Three. The club were Division Three runners-up in 2000–01 and were promoted to Division Two. The following season saw the club reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time; drawn at home to Stoke City, the match was moved to the Britannia Stadium with Stoke winning 2–0. The club finished the season by winning the Division Two title to secure promotion to Division One South;\r\n\r\nAfter winning the Division One South title in 2003–04, Lewes entered a series of play-offs for promotion to the newly formed Conference South; they defeated Yeading 1–0, Basingstoke Town 4–1 and Kingstonian 1–0 to earn a place in the new sixth tier division. Although the club finished fourth in the Conference South in its inaugural season, they were prevented from taking part in the promotion play-offs as the Dripping Pan did not meet the standards required for the Conference National. Another fourth-place finish in 2005–06 saw the club again denied the opportunity to participate in the play-offs.\r\n\r\nIn 2006–07 Lewes reached the first round of the FA Cup again, losing 4–1 at home to Darlington. The following season saw another first round appearance, ending in a 3–0 defeat at Mansfield Town. After winning the Conference South title at the end of the season, the club were promoted to the Conference National, having carried out works on the Dripping Pan. However, after winning the title, manager Steve King and all-but-one of the first team squad left the club. The following season saw them finish bottom of the Conference National, resulting in relegation back to the Conference South.\r\n\r\nIn 2010–11 Lewes were relegated to the Premier Division of the Isthmian League, where they played until being relegated to Division One South at the end of the 2015–16 season. They were Division One South runners-up in 2017–18, earning promotion back to the Premier Division. In the same year they launched Equality FC, with the aim of paying their men's and women's teams equal wages.",

The club competes in Football League One, the third tier of English football, and play home matches at Boundary Park. It is more commonly known as Oldham Athletic, or by its nickname Latics.\r\n\r\nThe history of Oldham Athletic A.F.C. begins with the founding of Pine Villa F.C. in 1895, playing in the Manchester and Lancashire leagues. When rivals Oldham County F.C. folded in 1899, Pine Villa F.C. moved into their stadium and changed their name to Oldham Athletic. They were Football League runners-up in the 1914–15 season but were relegated from the Football League First Division in 1923. They reached the 1990 Football League Cup Final and won the Football League Second Division title in 1991, ending 68 years outside the top tier of English football. They secured their top division status a year later to become founder members of the new Premier League but were relegated in 1994.\r\n\r\nAfter a period of insolvency in 2003–04, the club was taken over by a group of US-based expatriate British businessmen led by Simon Blitz.",

After the war they played in the Birmingham Combination, and were champions in 1953, before returning to the Birmingham and District.\r\n\r\nIn 1971 they changed their name to Redditch United and the following season joined the Southern League. In 1975–76 they won Division One North and were promoted to the Premier Division. In 1978–79 they finished eighth in the league, and became founder members of the Alliance Premier League. However, they finished bottom in their first season, and dropped into the Southern League's Midland Division.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing as runners-up in 1985–86, the club were promoted to the Premier Division, where they remained until relegation in 1989. The following season, they reached the first round of the FA Cup, losing 3–1 to Merthyr Tydfil.In 2003–04 the club won the Southern League Western Division, and then joined Conference North.\r\n\r\nOn 17 March 2011, businessman Chris Swan took over the club, after a previous attempt to purchase Kidderminster Harriers fell through. A short time later, in May 2011, the club was relegated from the Conference North after finishing bottom of the division.\r\n\r\nRedditch United returned to the Southern Premier Division for the 2011-12 season following their relegation the previous season. At the end of the 2015-16 season, the club finished second in the division under the management of Liam McDonald, but were denied promotion after losing in the play-off semi-finals to Leamington on penalty kicks.",

The team compete in League Two, the fourth tier of the English football league system.\r\n\r\nThe team is nicknamed The Iron, and has played in a home strip of claret and blue for most of its history. It plays its home games at Glanford Park, having moved from the Old Show Ground in 1988. Grimsby Town, Hull City, Doncaster Rovers, Lincoln City and York City are its main rivals, although Doncaster are the only one of these clubs that currently plays in Scunthorpe's division. It is currently the only league club located in Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\nThe club was formed in 1899, turned professional in 1912 and joined the Football League in 1950. It achieved promotion to Division Two in 1958, where it stayed until 1964, but has spent most of its time as a Football League club in the basement tier. The club has had more success recently, however: it was promoted from Football League Two in 2005, and has spent three of the last five seasons in the Football League Championship. The Iron were relegated to Football League One in 2011, having finished bottom of the Championship.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the club has developed a reputation for developing promising young strikers, having sold Billy Sharp, Martin Paterson and Gary Hooper on for seven-figure sums. The club was also considered one of the most financially prudent in English football, being one of only three in the top four divisions to be debt-free. This status has recently changed after it was announced that a £2 million loan from the outgoing chairman Steve Wharton was on the accounts to help the club maintain some sense of financial stability.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Southend United Football Club is a professional association football club based in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, England. As of the 2021–22 season, the team competes in the National League, the fifth tier of English football. Southend are known as \"The Shrimpers\", a reference to the area's maritime industry included as one of the quarters on the club badge. The club is owned by property developer Ron Martin.\r\n\r\nFounded on 19 May 1906 in the Blue Boar pub, Southend won the Southern League Second Division in both of their two initial seasons and were admitted into the Football League in 1920. They spent the next 44 years in the third tier of English football, before dropping into the Fourth Division in 1966. They spent the next 24 years moving between the third and fourth tiers, winning promotions in 1971–72, 1977–78, 1980–81 (as champions), 1986–87 and 1989–90. They were promoted into the Second Division for the first time at the end of the 1990–91 season. After six seasons in the second tier they suffered a double relegation in 1997 and 1998. Under the stewardship of Steve Tilson, Southend again secured a double promotion in 2004–05 and 2005–06 to win a place in the Championship as League One champions. However this time they only lasted one season in the second tier and were relegated back to League Two in 2010. They secured promotion as play-off winners in 2015, but suffered two successive relegations in 2020 and 2021, amidst financial problems. After 101 years in the Football League, the club were relegated to the National League in the 2020–21 season.\r\n\r\nThe club is based at Roots Hall Stadium in Prittlewell, with plans to move to a new stadium at Fossetts Farm. Southend have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Colchester United, with whom they contest the Essex derby.",

They failed to gain re-election in 1978 and since then have been members of the Northern Premier League (1978 to 1993), the Football Conference (1993 to 2003) and then the Northern Premier League Premier Division for its final season (2003–04). Southport were transferred to the new National League North in 2004 and, since then, have played in either that division (tier 6) or the tier 5 National League. In 2017, Southport were relegated from tier 5 to tier 6 and currently (2017–18) they are again playing in the National League North.\r\n\r\nSouthport first participated in the FA Cup in the 1882–83 tournament. Their best performance was in the 1930–31 tournament when they reached the quarter-finals (last eight) but were then beaten 9–1 by Everton at Goodison Park.

Southport took part in the Football League Cup from 1960 to 1978 but never progressed beyond the first two rounds. The team reached the final of the FA Trophy in 1997–98, played at the old Wembley Stadium, but lost 1–0 to Cheltenham Town.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "St Albans City Football Club (nicknamed The Saints) is a football club based in St Albans, Hertfordshire, England. It was founded in 1908 and plays its home matches at Clarence Park, about 800 yards from the city centre.\r\n\r\nThe club currently competes in the National League South (previously known as the Conference South), the sixth tier of English football. It competed in the Conference Premier (now the National League) during the 2006–07 season, but was relegated back to the Conference South after one season and subsequently suffered a further relegation in 2010–11, before returning to the sixth tier in 2013–14 after beating Chesham United FC 3–1 in the play-off final.\r\n\r\nCity's most famous match was on 22 November 1922 in a fourth round qualifying FA Cup match. Having been held by Dulwich Hamlet to a 1–1 draw at Clarence Park on 18 November, the replay drew a gate of 4,060. City's New Zealand-born goalkeeper W. Tennant did not appear, his place taken by Alf Fearn who was usually a half-back with the reserves. Dulwich put eight goals past him, the winning goal coming in near darkness at the end of extra time. What put the game in the record books was that City scored seven times, with all seven goals being scored by Wilfred Minter. His feat remains the highest tally by a player on the losing side of an FA Cup tie.",

The team spent most of their history in the lower reaches of the Football League, but the 1990s were more successful with the club competing in the First Division (now known as the Championship) for five seasons, whilst they also reached the League Cup semi-finals in 1996–97. However, instability on and off the pitch eventually led to Stockport falling back to the lower divisions. The club started the 2011–12 season in the Conference National, having been relegated from Football League Two for the first time in their history at the end of 2010–11. At the end of 2012–13, Stockport were relegated to the Conference North.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Stratford Town Football Club is a football club representing the town of Stratford upon Avon, Warwickshire, England, but currently based in nearby Tiddington. They are currently members of the Southern League Premier Division Central and play at Knights Lane.\r\n\r\nThe club was formed in 1941 as Stratford Rangers, changing their name in 1949. After playing in various local leagues they joined the Worcestershire Combination (which later became the Midland Football Combination) in 1954. In 1957 they switched to the Birmingham and District League, which became the West Midlands (Regional) League in 1962, but rejoined the Combination in 1970. In 1975 they took the unusual step of joining the Hellenic League, which does not normally include teams from Warwickshire. After two unsuccessful seasons they rejoined the Midland Combination once again, where they remained until becoming founder members of the Midland Football Alliance in 1994.\r\n\r\nThe club entered financial difficulty in 1998 and were reformed to become Stratford Town F.C.\r\n\r\nOn 20 April 2013, a 1–1 draw with Stourport Swifts sealed the Midland Alliance title and promotion to the Southern Football League for the first time in the club's history, where they initially played in Division One South & West. After two seasons in the Division One South & West, Stratford Town earned promotion to the Premier Division via the play-offs with a 3–2 win against Larkhall Athletic on 4 May 2015. They successfully retained their status the following season.\r\n\r\nThe 2021–22 season saw The Bards reach the first round proper of the FA Cup for the first time in their history, defeating National League North side Boston United 3–2 in a fourth qualifying round replay after an initial 1–1 draw at the Boston Community Stadium. Stratford were drawn at home to League One side Shrewsbury Town, with the match televised on ITV4. Despite scoring first, they were eventually defeated 5–1 in front of a sell-out 2,800 spectators at Knights Lane.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Sutton United Football Club is a professional football club in Sutton, South London, England, who play in the National League, the fifth tier of English football. They will compete in the EFL League Two for the 2021–22 season, having been crowned National League champions in 2020–21. They play home games at Gander Green Lane, close to West Sutton Station. The club is an FA Charter Standard Community Club affiliated to the Surrey County Football Association.\r\n\r\nSutton started out playing in junior, local leagues, but progressed into the Athenian League in 1921; the Isthmian League in 1964; and the Conference in 1986. The team fell back into the Isthmian League in 1991. Sutton won the Athenian League three times (1927–28, 1945–46 and 1957–58) and the Isthmian League five times (1966–67, 1984–85, 1985–86, 1998–99 and 2010–11). They appeared in the Conference for one more season in 1999–2000, and were founding members of the Conference South (now known as National League South) in 2004. Sutton won the National League South in 2015–16 and achieved their very first promotion to the Football League after winning the National League title in the 2020–21 season.\r\n\r\nThe team has had several cup successes, including playing at Wembley in the FA Amateur Cup final twice and in the FA Trophy final in 1981. Sutton won the Anglo-Italian Cup in 1979, but the club is most famous for its FA Cup \"giant killing\" exploits, most notably in the 1988–89 season, when they defeated Coventry City 2–1 in the Third Round. The Coventry team was composed mostly of star international players and had won the competition in 1987. In the 2016–17 season, Sutton reached the Fifth Round of the FA Cup for the first time in their history, beating three Football League teams (Cheltenham Town, AFC Wimbledon and Leeds United) before losing 2–0 at home to Arsenal.",

The club participates in the Southern League Premier Division Central under the management of Andrew Danylyszyn and Gary Smith.\r\n\r\nThe club was formed in 1933 after the previous Tamworth club, Tamworth Castle, ceased to exist. After playing in the Birmingham Combination and West Midlands (Regional) League, the team reached the Southern League in 1972, but subsequently fell on hard times and returned to lower level football. In 1989 Tamworth returned to the Southern League and a year later won the FA Vase. Tamworth reached the final of the FA Trophy in 2003 and in the same season won promotion to the Football Conference, going on to spend four seasons at the highest level of non-League football before being relegated to the Conference North. In 2009 the club gained promotion back to the Conference Premier, and spent five seasons at that level before being relegated. Further relegation in 2018 took the club back to the Southern League.\r\n\r\nThe team originally played at The Jolly Sailor Ground but after a year moved into The Lamb Ground, named after a pub which formerly stood nearby. The stadium currently has a capacity of just under 5,000 and a 3G artificial pitch which was laid in 2016. Local rivals include Burton Albion and Nuneaton Town, and to a lesser degree Atherstone Town, Bedworth United and Bolehall Swifts.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Taunton Town Football Club are an English football club based in Taunton, Somerset. They compete in the Southern League Premier Division South and play their home matches at their Wordsworth Drive ground which they moved into during the 1953 season. The club is affiliated to the Somerset County FA.\r\n\r\nAfter being formed in 1947, they were admitted into the Western League in 1954. They struggled over the next ten years, and it was not until the 1970s that the club started to prosper. Having won the Western League in 1968–69, the club then finished as runners-up in the same league in four successive seasons from 1973. They gained promotion to the Southern League in 1977 and purchased their ground from the local council. In the early 1980s they dropped back down into the Western League for financial reasons, but did not enjoy further success until 1989–90. The following twelve seasons saw the club win the title on four more occasions (1995–96, 1998–99, 1999–2000 and 2000–01) and finish as runners-up four times (1993–94, 1996–97, 1997–98 and 2001–02).\r\n\r\nIn 2001 the club won the FA Vase, which it had narrowly missed out on seven years earlier. Following their string of good results, Taunton rejoined the Southern League for the 2002–03 season. After the latest re-organisation of the English football league system, the club are currently members of the Southern League Premier Division South.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Tiverton Town Football Club are an English football club based in Tiverton, Devon. The club are currently members of the Southern League Premier Division South and play at Ladysmead.\r\n\r\nThe club was established in 1913 as Tiverton Athletic, and initially played at the Athletic Ground. They joined the East Devon League, winning the Senior Division in 1924–25, 1925–26, 1926–27 and 1927–28. They then joined the North Devon League, winning it in 1931–32, after which they transferred to the Exeter & District League, which they won in 1933–34.\r\n\r\nIn 1951–52 the club won the league's Senior Division, and in 1956 won the Devon Senior Cup for the first time. They won the league again in 1964–65 and 1965–66, a season in which they also won the Senior Cup for a second time.\r\n\r\nIn 1973 the club joined the Western League. They were relegated to Division One at the end of the 1980–81 season after finishing bottom of the league. After finishing as runners-up in 1988–89, they were promoted back to the Premier Division. Following two fourth-placed finishes, the club finished third in 1991–92, second in 1992–93 (a season in which they also won the League Cup for the first time), and won the league and League Cup double in 1993–94. They won the league again the following season, and after finishing as runners-up in 1995–96, a season in which they also picked up the League Cup, achieved back-to-back titles again in 1996–97 (a double season) and 1997–98. They also won the FA Vase in 1998, beating Tow Law Town 1–0 in the final.\r\n\r\nIn 1998–99 the club won the FA Vase again, beating Bedlington Terriers 1–0, and finished second in the league, earning promotion to Division One West of the Southern League. In 2000–01 they finished second, and were promoted to the Premier Division, where they remained until 2011. In 2006–07 they won the Southern League Cup.\r\n\r\nOn 18 April 2012 it was announced in the national press that Tiverton had appointed 27-year-old internet entrepreneur Matthew Conridge as their new chairman. Believed to be one of the youngest football chairman in the UK ever Conridge was quoted as saying, \"I'm not here to chuck thousands of pounds into a black hole, I'm here to pull everyone together and work with a good team......This club will not spend more than it can afford to chase a dream......If we can't afford a budget to go to Blue Square Bet South we won't pay it\".\r\n\r\nOn 30 April 2013 Tiverton Town released a press release as follows \"Tiverton Town can confirm that Matthew Conridge has stepped down as Chairman of Tiverton Town to pursue other business interests. The club would like to place on record its gratitude for all his hard work whilst in the position. Former Tivvy chairman Dave Wright is taking over the position of chairman for the time being. The club also wishes to confirm the departure of interim manager Jamie Ward together with his assistant Paul Short.\"\r\n\r\nIn May 2013 Tiverton town released the following press release to announce the arrival of John Clarkson as their new manager \"John Clarkson was tonight introduced to the media and Tivvy fans at a press conference at Ladysmead. Clarkson has arrived from Spain where he was manager of Ontinyent in Segunda B. He had been managing in Spain for the last six years\".\r\n\r\nIn May 2014, Tiverton Town manager John Clarkson stepped down from the position following the teams disappointing 2–0 Devon Bowl Final defeat to Plymouth Parkway who were playing in the league below Tiverton. He had led the side to the play-off's, where they lost to 9-man Paulton, and two Cup finals but cited the last couple of months as the reason he was going, \"The last couple of months have really taken it out of me, three or four games a week was just too much\" He added,\"I'm off to take my coaching badges during the summer and once I've completed them I will decide on what I'm going to do\" Despite a much higher wage budget than other teams in the league (due to John Clarkson's financial input) the club could not reach its aim of promotion in its centenary season. At the end of the season many of the club's higher profile players left following John Clarkson's resignation and the reduction of the wage budget. Yellows legend Martyn Rogers was named as Clarkson's replacement and given the task of rebuilding the squad on a much more restricted wage budget.\r\n\r\nIn the 2016\/17 season Tiverton Town gained promotion to the Southern League Premier Division. They beat Salisbury 0–2 with goals from Michael Landricombe and Tom Bath in the playoff final in front of over 2,000, returning them to the Southern League Premier after being relegated in 2011.\r\n\r\nIn the 2017\/18 season following promotion from the 8th teir Tivvy finished in a highly respectable position of 6th. Especially considering the low budget and crowds compared to the top 5 and most of the league. However despite this Tivvy managed to beat 4 of the top 5 with playoff hopes ending due to poor away form.",

Founded in 1945 following the amalgamation of Walton FC and Hersham FC, they currently play in the Isthmian League South Central Division. The club is affiliated to the Surrey County Football Association.\r\n\r\nThe club joined the Corinthian League upon formation, and after a difficult first season won three consecutive league titles. In 1950, the club moved to the Athenian League, and were later placed in the Premier Division upon expansion in 1963. Walton & Hersham were named league champions for a fourth time during the 1968–69 season, and shortly after joined the Isthmian League. The club's most successful period soon followed, which saw them reach the FA Cup Second Round and win the FA Amateur Cup at Wembley Stadium, although the departure of manager Allen Batsford and several players to Wimbledon saw the club quickly relegated to the Isthmian League Division Two.\r\n\r\nAfter coming close to extinction in the late 1970s, former Ballon d'Or winner Sir Stanley Matthews was briefly named as president and the club later managed to find consistency throughout the 1980s. The Swans regularly earned promotion and suffered relegation between the Isthmian League divisions throughout the next decades, and named Millwall chairman Theo Paphitis as a board member for several years. Following the 2015–16 season, the club suffered relegation to the Combined Counties Premier Division and began to struggle once again.\r\n\r\nIn August 2017, Walton & Hersham left Stompond Lane and moved into the Elmbridge Sports Hub – a £20 million sports complex development shared with local rivals Walton Casuals. After three seasons in the ninth tier of English football, the club suffered further relegation to the Combined Counties Division One and long-term owner Alan Smith stepped down from his position. In July 2019, the club was taken over by a group of students, who claim to be the youngest owners in world football.\r\n\r\nWalton & Hersham are the inspiration behind the name of punk band Sham 69, which was derived from a piece of graffiti reading 'Walton & Hersham 69'.",

Founded in 1948, they currently play in the Southern League Premier Division South. The club is affiliated to the Surrey County Football Association, and has been a part of the football pyramid since 1992.\r\n\r\nThe club joined the Surrey Intermediate League upon formation, and remained there until the league disbanded in 1965. A move to the Surrey Senior League lasted just two years before becoming founding members of the Suburban League. Walton Casuals won their first major honour in 1983 as champions of the Suburban League Southern Section. In 1992, the club turned semi-professional and entered the football pyramid by joining the Surrey Premier League. The Stags earned promotion to the Combined Counties Football League in 1995, and the Isthmian League 10 years later. After two years of groundsharing, the club moved into the Elmbridge Sports Hub – a £20 million sports complex development – for the 2017–18 season. In their first season at the new stadium, Walton secured a top six finish on goal difference and went on to win the play-offs.\r\n\r\nWalton Casuals' most notable rivalry comes with Combined Counties Premier Division club Walton & Hersham, due to their close proximity. The club also has a rivalry with Molesey, who play in the Isthmian League South Division. The two teams previously competed in an annual pre-season fixture for the Mick Burgess Memorial Trophy, but the competition was halted when Molesey earned promotion to the same league in 2015.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Welling United Football Club is a professional association football club, based in Welling in the London Borough of Bexley, England. The club's first team play in the National League South, the sixth tier of English football.\r\n\r\nWelling United Football Club was founded in 1963. It began as a youth team, playing in the Eltham & District Sunday League on a park pitch from 1963–64 to 1970–71. From 1971–72 to 1974–75, it played in the Metropolitan-London League Intermediate\/Reserves Division. In 1975–76 it played in the London Spartan League Reserve Division One. It gained senior status in the London Spartan League in 1976, at Butterfly Lane, Eltham. It finished sixth in Division 2 in 1976–77 and was promoted to the Premier Division. In 1977 Welling moved to the Park View Road ground, which had previously belonged to the then defunct Bexley United. It joined the Athenian League in 1978. In 1981 it progressed to the Southern Football League Southern Division.\r\n\r\nAfter just one season at this level the club found itself in the Southern League Premier Division after the league was re-organised. In 1985–86 it won the league title by 23 points and were promoted to the Football Conference.\r\n\r\nAlthough it struggled in the Conference, only twice finishing above 11th place in 14 seasons, it did enjoy cup success during this period, reaching the first round proper of the FA Cup in six successive seasons, on one occasion knocking out Kent's only Football League side, Gillingham. It also made one third round appearance, losing 1–0 at Park View Road to Blackburn Rovers.\r\n\r\nThe club was relegated in 1999–2000 and returned to the Southern League.\r\n\r\nIn the 2003–04 season, under the management of former England World Cup player Paul Parker, the Wings finished in the top half of the Southern League Premier Division and was therefore able to claim a place in the newly formed Conference South. In that season, Parker left the club by mutual consent.\r\n\r\n\r\nWelling playing Millwall in a pre-season friendly at Park View Road.\r\nFormer Coventry City and Republic of Ireland player Liam Daish took charge of the team on a caretaker basis before the permanent position was handed to former Norwich City and Gillingham defender Adrian Pennock, who narrowly missed out on taking the club into the promotion play-offs. Pennock left the club at the end of the 2006–07 season. His last game managing the Wings finished in a 1–1 draw at home to Hayes. Pennock joined Stoke City in a coaching position under his former Gillingham manager, Tony Pulis.\r\n\r\nOn 16 May 2007, Welling United appointed Neil Smith as the new first team manager. However, after only seven months in charge Smith parted company with the club on 7 January 2008. It was mutually agreed between the club and Smith that his reign as Wings boss would end.\r\n\r\nAndy Ford was appointed the new manager of the Wings on 31 January 2008. Despite losing 6–2 to Cambridge City in his first game in charge, Ford guided the Wings to safety and they eventually finished 16th. Welling finished 7th in the Conference South in 2008\/09 under the guidance of Ford. After a poor start to the 2009–10 season Ford resigned stating he didn't think he could achieve what he wanted on the current budget. Jamie Day was announced as the new player\/manager in November 2009.\r\n\r\nOn 12 August 2010, the club was served with a winding-up petition by HMRC, due for a hearing later that month. The Wings were given 14 weeks to pay the outstanding debt to the HMRC, and thanks almost entirely to the supporters were able to raise £60,000 to clear all monies owed. During this period, in a Football Conference Hearing on 16 September 2010, Welling United admitted to a misconduct charge in connection with the outstanding HMRC debt. Resultantly an immediate deduction of 5 points was enforced on the club together with a suspended £5,000 fine.\r\n\r\nDespite the Wings having a transfer embargo enforced upon them and also being deducted 5 points by the Football Conference, all within four weeks of the start of 2010–11 season, Jamie Day's side were competitively competing for the Conference South title. However, even though Welling United were in the top 5 for almost half of the season, a string of poor results in the final month of the campaign saw the Wings miss out on a play-off place by one point, with a final position of 6th.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormer player manager Jamie Day with the Conference South trophy after winning the title in 2013\r\nThe 2011–12 season ended with Welling in 3rd place and after defeating Sutton United 2–1 on aggregate in the play-off semi-finals they narrowly missed promotion in the final, going down 0–1 to Dartford at Princes Park.\r\n\r\nWelling made a return to the top level of non-league football the following season after clinching the Conference South title, 13 years after they last played at the fifth tier of English football. Between 3 November and 5 February, Welling also broke the league's record for consecutive wins with 12 in a row.\r\n\r\nIn December 2014 Jamie Day left Welling by mutual consent. He was replaced by Jake Gallagher and Jamie Turner as caretakers, but on 21 December it was announced that Jody Brown of Grays Athletic would become manager. On 3 March 2015, Jody Brown was relieved of his duties after just one point in his first nine games. Right back Loui Fazakerley was put in charge for \"the foreseeable future\".\r\n\r\nWelling's first televised home match was played on 8 March 2015 in front of the BT Sport cameras losing 1–0 to Altrincham.\r\n\r\nFollowing an impressive run of results, Fazakerley steered The Wings out of the relegation zone and to Conference Premier safety on goal difference above Alfreton Town. Fazakerley was appointed on a full-time basis the same week.\r\n\r\nOn 25 January 2016 Loui Fazakerley was sacked after 10 months in charge, with the club in the National League relegation zone and was replaced with former first team coach under Jamie Day, Dean Frost and Barry Ashby as assistant manager. Jamie Turner also came back as goalkeeping coach.\r\n\r\nFrost's first match in charge was away against FC Halifax Town and finished 1–1, Welling's first goal and point at The Shay.",

Nicknamed \"The Seagulls\", the club is affiliated to the Somerset County Football Association and currently competes in the National League South, the sixth tier of English football.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1887 but disbanded twice (for the two World Wars); the current club was established in 1948. Their claim to fame is that they have never been relegated in their history, although since their promotion to the sixth tier in 2004 they have been reprieved from relegation three times (in 2007, 2008 and 2010). The team's best performance in the FA Cup came in 2003–04 when they reached the second round of the competition.\r\n\r\nWeston-super-Mare has a modest fan base and a fierce rivalry with fellow Somerset club Clevedon Town. However, the two clubs have not played in the same league since Weston-super-Mare gained promotion to the Southern League Premier Division in 2003.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Worthing Football Club are an English association football club based in Worthing, West Sussex, currently playing in the Isthmian League Premier Division. The club plays at Woodside Road.\r\n\r\nThe club was formed as Worthing Association Football Club (a name that lasted until 1899) in February 1886 and played friendlies and Sussex Senior Cup ties for the first few years of their existence.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the club became founding members of the West Sussex Football League, joining the Senior Division. During their time in the West Sussex league they were league champions on seven occasions. In May 1900 the club absorbed local rivals Worthing Athletic and a year later moved to its current home, then known as the Sports Ground, now as Woodside Road. In 1905 another rival team, Worthing Rovers, was also absorbed.\r\n\r\nThe club's intriguing nickname of \"The Rebels\" dates from when it resigned from the West Sussex League on a point of principle over a rule change, prior to becoming a founder member of the Sussex County League in 1920. Worthing are also known as \"The Mackerel Men\", a reference to the three fish on the club crest.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 Worthing became founder members of the Sussex County League, where once again they won eight league titles, in fact in the twenty seasons prior to World War II they only finished outside the top four on two occasions.\r\n\r\nIn 1948–49 Worthing joined the Corinthian League but met with little success. In 1963 the Corinthian League disbanded and most of its clubs joined the newly created Athenian League Division One, where Worthing won promotion at the first attempt, although after three seasons in the Premier Division, two successive relegations saw them drop to Division 2.\r\n\r\nAfter managing a return to the top division, Worthing joined the Isthmian League in 1977, initially in Division Two, but by 1983 they had reached the Premier Division under manager Barry Lloyd and in fact finished as runners-up in 1983–84 and 1984–85. After Lloyd's departure to Brighton & Hove Albion, however, the club soon slipped back down to Division Two, finishing bottom of Division One in the 1990–91 season with only 10 points and having conceded a huge 157 goals.\r\n\r\nFormer Northern Ireland international Gerry Armstrong was appointed manager in 1991 and in 1992–93 led the club to promotion back to Division One, which was followed two years later by a return to the Premier Division under John Robson, although Worthing finished bottom in their first season back in the Premier Division and were to remain in Division One until 2004 when the re-organisation of the English football league system saw them moved back to the Premier Division. They were relegated at the end of the 2006–07 season.\r\n\r\nThe club then reached the play-offs under manager Alan Pook two seasons in a row, losing both matches without scoring a goal. Unknown young manager, Simon Colbran then took the helm and soon became a fans' favourite as the Rebels topped the league for much of Autumn and Winter. Despite several budget cuts, the Rebels finished third and narrowly missed out in the play offs at home to Godalming.\r\n\r\nFormer Brighton & Hove Albion player Adam Hinshelwood was appointed Worthing manager in December 2013 and lost his first game away at Burgess Hill 4–1. In January 2015 the playing budget at the club was completely cut and its debts revealed to be around £200,000. The future of the club looked in serious doubt until March 2015 when local football enthusiast George Dowell became the majority shareholder in the club with plans to invest in various areas. On 10 June 2015, Hinshelwood resigned from the club to take up a full-time coaching post at Brighton & Hove Albion. He was replaced by assistant manager Jon Meeney and 29-year-old defender Gary Elphick.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, Worthing were promoted to the Isthmian League Premier Division via the play-off, having finished the 2015-16 season in third place in the southern division. Player-manager Gary Elphick was on the scoresheet in the play-off final. In late 2017, Adam Hinshelwood returned to the club as first team manager.",

Founded in 1895, Yeovil took 108 years to enter the Football League when they were promoted from the Football Conference as champions in 2003.\r\n\r\nYeovil have been one of the most successful non-league teams in the FA Cup – having defeated major Football League teams, most famously Sunderland in the 4th Round in 1949, going on to play in front of more than 81,000 against Manchester United at Maine Road, temporarily shared with local rival Manchester City following the bombing of Old Trafford in the Second World War. Since entering the Football League FA Cup results have deteriorated having only reached the 3rd Round twice including, in 2004, against Liverpool for which the club released a record prior to the tie sold only in shops in the town, \"Yeovil True\" reached #36 in the UK Singles Chart. The only other successful performance since then was in 2005 when they reached the 4th Round, drawn away against then Premier League side Charlton Athletic where they narrowly lost 3–2.\r\n\r\nTheir home ground is Huish Park, built in 1990 on the site of an old army camp and named after their former home, Huish, itself known for its pitch, which had an 8 feet (2.4 m) sideline to sideline slope. The club's nickname The Glovers is a reference to the history of glove-making in the town of Yeovil, which became a centre of the industry during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.",

York achieved their best run in the FA Cup in 1954–55, when they met Newcastle United in the semi-final. They fluctuated between the Third and Fourth Divisions, before spending two seasons in the Second Division in the 1970s. York first played at Wembley Stadium in 1993, when they won the Third Division play-off final. At the end of 2003–04, they lost their Football League status after being relegated from the Third Division. The 2011–12 FA Trophy was the first national knockout competition won by York, and they returned to the Football League that season before being relegated back into non-League football in 2016.\r\n\r\nYork are nicknamed the Minstermen, after York Minster, and the team traditionally play in red kits. They played at Fulfordgate from 1922 to 1932, when they moved to Bootham Crescent, their home for 88 years. This ground had been subject to numerous improvements over the years, but the club lost ownership of it when it was transferred to a holding company in 1999. York bought it back five years later, but the terms of the loan used to do so necessitated a move to a new ground. They moved into their current ground, the York Community Stadium, in 2021. York have had rivalries with numerous clubs, but their traditional rivals are Hull City and Scarborough. The club's record appearance holder is Barry Jackson, who made 539 appearances, while their leading scorer is Norman Wilkinson, with 143 goals.",
