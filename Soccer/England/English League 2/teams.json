            "strDescriptionEN": "AFC Wimbledon is an English professional football club, based in Merton, London, which has played in League One, the third tier of the English football league system, since winning promotion in 2016. The club's home stadium is Plough Lane.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 2002 by former supporters of Wimbledon F.C. after the Football Association allowed that club to relocate to Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, about 60 miles (97 km) north of Wimbledon. Most of the Wimbledon F.C. supporters were very strongly opposed to moving the club so far away from Wimbledon, feeling that a club transplanted to a distant location would no longer represent Wimbledon or the club's historic legacy and tradition. Wimbledon F.C. moved in 2003 and formally changed the name of the club to Milton Keynes Dons in 2004.\r\n\r\nWhen AFC Wimbledon was formed, it affiliated to both the London and Surrey Football Associations, and entered the Premier Division of the Combined Counties League, the ninth tier of English football. The club has since been promoted six times in 13 seasons, going from the ninth tier (Combined Counties Premier) to the third (League One).\r\n\r\nAFC Wimbledon currently hold the record for the longest unbeaten run of league matches in English senior football, having played 78 consecutive league games without a defeat between February 2003 and December 2004. They are the first club formed in the 21st century to make it into the Football League.\r\n\r\nThe club was initially based at Kingsmeadow, a ground bought from and then shared with Isthmian League club Kingstonian F.C. until 2017, and with Chelsea F.C. Women from 2017. In November 2020, the club moved to Plough Lane, a new stadium on the site of the defunct Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium, only 250 yards away from the original Plough Lane, Wimbledon F.C.'s home until 1991. The new stadium has an initial capacity of 9,300, with the option of expansion to a maximum 20,000 at a later date.",

The club will participate in EFL League Two, the fourth tier of the English league system, in the 2020–21 season, having been promoted as champions from the National League in 2019–20. Since 1909, Barrow have played their home games at Holker Street (currently sponsored for the 2019–20 season as the \"Progression Solicitors Stadium\"), close to the town centre and approximately half a mile from Barrow Railway Station.\r\n\r\nBarrow spent 51 years in the Football League between 1921 and 1972, achieving promotion to the Third Division by finishing third in the Fourth Division in the 1966–67 season. The club's highest-ever league placing was achieved in 1967–68 when the team finished eighth in the Third Division, but a decline quickly set in from this point and, at the end of the 1971–72 season, Barrow were voted out of the Football League in the re-election process. They subsequently spent 48 seasons in the top two levels of non-league football, with five relegations from and promotions to the Alliance Premier League (later the Football Conference and now the National League), of which they were a founder member in 1979. During this time they twice won non-league football's most prestigious cup competition, the FA Trophy, in 1990 and 2010, becoming the only club to win the tournament at both the old and new Wembley Stadiums.\r\n\r\nThe club colours are blue and white, though the combination of these has varied over time, leading to their nickname \"The Bluebirds\". The record attendance at Holker Street is 16,874 set against Swansea Town in the 1954 FA Cup third round.",

The team compete in League Two, the fourth tier of the English football league system. \r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1903. It was immediately elected into Division Two of the Football League despite not having played a previous game. Promotion to the top tier followed in 1908 and the club won the FA Cup in 1911, its only major honour. After relegation in 1922 from Division One, the club spent 77 years outside the top flight until promotion to the Premier League in 1999. City stayed up, with a then record low of 36 points, in the first season in the Premier League. Relegation followed the following season. Since then a series of financial crises did push the club to the brink of closure. The financial pressure resulted in two more relegations to League Two. In the 2012–13 season, they became the first ever team from the fourth tier of English football to reach a major domestic Wembley cup final, the Football League Cup, losing 5–0 to Swansea City. In the same season, they returned to Wembley for the playoff final and won promotion to League One with a 3–0 win over Northampton Town.\r\n\r\nThe club's colours are claret and amber and they play their home games at Valley Parade. The ground was the site of a fire on 11 May 1985, which took the lives of 56 supporters.\r\n\r\nBradford City have had more than 40 managers, all of whom have been from Great Britain or Ireland. The current manager is Stuart McCall.\r\n\r\nThe club is linked with American amateur side SC United Bantams.",

From the 2021–22 season, the club will compete in League One, the third tier of the English football league system, after winning the League Two title. Nicknamed the \"Robins\", they have played at Whaddon Road since 1932. The club contests rivalries with Gloucester City and Forest Green Rovers.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1887, the club spent much of its early history competing in local football circles, before moving to the Birmingham Combination in 1932 and then the Southern League in 1935. They spent the next 50 years in the Southern League, winning the Midland Division in 1982–83 and then claiming the Premier Division title in 1984–85. They were subsequently promoted into the Alliance Premier League in 1985, where they remained for seven seasons until they were relegated in 1992. They finished as runners-up of the Southern League Premier Division for four of the next five seasons, and were promoted into the Conference in 1997.\r\n\r\nUnder the stewardship of Steve Cotterill, Cheltenham won the 1998 FA Trophy final and then secured promotion into the Football League for the first time after winning the Conference title in 1998–99. He left the club after the 2001–02 season, having guided them to the FA Cup fifth round and promotion with victory in the 2002 Third Division play-off final. Immediately relegated after one season in the Second Division, they secured another promotion as manager John Ward guided them to victory in the 2006 League Two play-off final. Relegated after three seasons in the third tier, the club's 16-year stay in the Football League ended with relegation back to the National League in 2015. However manager Gary Johnson led Cheltenham to the Conference title with a 101 point tally in 2015–16, making them the first club in 26 years to secure an immediate return to the Football League as champions of the Conference. After Michael Duff took over from Johnson, he led the club to its first Football League title, winning the 2020–21 League Two title.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Chesterfield Football Club \/ˈtʃɛstərfiːld\/ is a professional association football club based in the town of Chesterfield, Derbyshire, England. The team competes in the National League, the fifth tier of the English football league system. Chesterfield play their home games at the 10,504 capacity Proact Stadium, having moved from their historic home of Saltergate during the summer of 2010. Notable players include record appearance holder Dave Blakey, who played in 617 of Chesterfield's league games, and 162 league goal club record holder Ernie Moss. The club contests numerous minor local rivalries, though Nottinghamshire club Mansfield Town are considered to be their main rivals.\r\n\r\nChesterfield F.C. was officially established in 1866, though it would be the third incarnation of that name that turned professional in 1891 and changed its name to Chesterfield Town. Town entered the FA Cup for the first time the following year, and competed in the Sheffield & District League and Sheffield & Hallamshire Senior Cup, before joining the Midland League in 1896–97. A third-place finish in 1898–99 resulted in a successful application to the Football League Second Division for the following season. After ten seasons in the Second Division they failed to gain re-election to the League and returned to the Midland League in 1909, finishing as champions in 1909–10. The club entered liquidation in 1915, and were reformed as Chesterfield Municipal in April 1919. They again rejoined the Midland League and finished as champions in 1919–20.\r\n\r\nThe club was renamed to Chesterfield F.C. in December 1920, and became founder members of the Third Division North in 1921–22. They marked their tenth season in the division, 1930–31, by winning the title, though only managed two seasons in the Second Division before suffering relegation. They again won the Third Division North title in 1935–36, and after World War II recorded their best ever league finish of fourth in the Second Division in 1946–47. However they were relegated again in 1950–51, and were relegated out of the Third Division in 1960–61. Chesterfield won the Fourth Division in 1969–70, and then won the Anglo-Scottish Cup in 1980. After relegation in 1982–83, they again won the Fourth Division title in 1984–85, though would again be relegated after five seasons in the third tier. They secured their return to the third tier with a 2–0 win over Bury in the 1995 play-off Final at Wembley.\r\n\r\nChesterfield reached the FA Cup semi-finals in 1997, but were relegated back to the basement division in 1999–2000. They made an immediate return to the third tier after securing a Third Division automatic promotion place in 2000–01. Relegated in 2006–07, they secured the League Two title in 2010–11, but were relegated from League One the following season. In 2011, Dave Allen took full ownership of the club and oversaw progress to two League Trophy finals; Chesterfield won the trophy with a 2–0 victory over Swindon Town in 2012, and finished as runners-up after losing 3–1 to Peterborough United in 2014. Chesterfield were crowned champions of League Two for a record fourth time in 2013–14, but remained in League One for just three seasons. Two consecutive relegations saw the club relegated out of the English Football League at the end of the 2017–18 season.",

The club compete in League One, the third tier of the English football league system.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1937, the club spent its early years playing in the Southern Football League until they were elected to The Football League in 1950. Between 1950 and 1990, Colchester spent their time between the Third Division and Fourth Division, during which time they produced one of their most memorable results, a 3–2 victory in the fifth round of the FA Cup over Don Revie's Leeds United in 1971.\r\n\r\nColchester United were relegated to the Football Conference in 1990 following a decline in the late 1980s, but won the Conference title in 1992 to make a swift return to League football. They achieved promotion to the Second Division in 1998 following a 1–0 win against Torquay United in the play-off final. The club were again promoted in 2006, achieving second place in League One. The following season, they achieved their highest league finish in club history, ending the season 10th in the Championship ahead of East Anglian rivals Ipswich Town, Norwich City and also Essex rivals Southend United, despite having the division's lowest attendance. The club returned to League One in 2008 following relegation from the Championship.\r\n\r\nColchester United play their home games at Colchester Community Stadium in Colchester. They relocated to the stadium in 2008 when they moved away from Layer Road, their home stadium for 71 years.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Crewe Alexandra Football Club is a professional association football club based in the town of Crewe, Cheshire, England. The team will compete in League One, the third tier of the English football league system, in the 2020-21 season. Nicknamed The Railwaymen because of the town's links with the rail industry, they have played at Gresty Road since 1906, when they moved from their original home at the Alexandra Recreation Ground. Supporters maintain rivalries with a number of nearby clubs, their fiercest rivals being Staffordshire-based side Port Vale.\r\n\r\nThe club was formed in 1877 and named after Princess Alexandra. They entered the Football Alliance league in 1889, before becoming founding members of the Football League Second Division in 1892. However they failed to be re-elected into the Football League after finishing bottom of the division in 1895–96. They spent the next three seasons in the Lancashire League, before spending ten years competing in the Birmingham & District League. They spent the 1910s in The Central League, before they were invited to join the newly created Football League Third Division North in 1921, where they spent the following 37 years. After three consecutive last-place Third Division North finishes, they were placed in the newly formed Fourth Division, and went on to achieve their first promotion after securing a third-place finish in 1962–63. Immediately relegated, they were promoted again in 1967–68, but again lasted just one season in the Third Division.\r\n\r\nCrewe spent 20 years struggling in the fourth tier, being forced to apply for re-election on seven occasions, before their fortunes were revived under manager Dario Gradi, who secured promotion at the end of the 1988–89 campaign. Relegated after two seasons, they were again promoted in 1993–94, and after two unsuccessful play-off campaigns, won the 1997 Second Division play-off final to win a place in the second tier after an absence of 101 years. They spent eight of the next nine seasons in the First Division \/ Championship, securing automatic promotion from the Second Division in 2002–03 after being relegated the previous season. Gradi resigned in July 2007, with the club in League One. During Gradi's 24-year tenure Crewe built a reputation for playing attractive, technical football and the Crewe Alexandra Academy forged a reputation for developing young players. Future England internationals David Platt, Danny Murphy and Dean Ashton began their professional careers at the club, whilst Nick Powell was sold for a club record £6 million in 2012.\r\n\r\nGradi returned first on a caretaker basis and then on a permanent basis from 2009 to 2011 following relegation into League Two at the end of the 2008–09 campaign. New manager Steve Davis led the club to promotion via the play-offs in 2012 and then to the Football League Trophy title in 2013. They spent four seasons in League One, before being relegated in last place in 2015–16. The club was heavily implicated in the football sexual abuse scandal that came to public attention in 2016, facing criticism for their handling of youth coach Barry Bennell, who was gaoled in 2018 for child sexual abuse. In the 2019–20 season, shortened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Crewe secured promotion to League One, under David Artell, manager since January 2017.",

They changed their name to Fleetwood Town in 2002 and were taken over by Andrew Pilley two years later, who would transform the club's fortunes with significant financial investments. Fleetwood won the North West Counties League Premier Division title in 2004–05, promotion out of the Northern Premier League First Division in 2005–06, the Northern Premier League Premier Division title in 2007–08 and the Conference North play-offs in 2010. Fleetwood won the Conference National title in 2011–12 to secure a place in the Football League for the first time. In May 2014, Fleetwood beat Burton Albion at Wembley in the League Two play-off final to gain promotion League One; the club's sixth promotion in ten years.",

They were voted out of the league in favour of Ipswich Town at the end of the 1937–38 season, but returned to it 12 years later after it was expanded from 88 to 92 clubs. Twice in the late 1980s they came close to winning promotion to the second tier of English football, but a decline then set in and in 1993 they narrowly avoided relegation to the Football Conference. Between 2000 and 2005, Gillingham were in the second tier of the English football league system for the only time in their history, achieving a club record highest league finish of eleventh place in 2002–03.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Grimsby Town Football Club is a professional football club based in Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, England, that competes in League Two, the fourth tier of the English football league system. Nicknamed \"the Mariners\", the club was founded as Grimsby Pelham Football Club in 1878, changed its name to Grimsby Town a year later, and moved to its current stadium, Blundell Park, in 1898.\r\n\r\nGrimsby Town were the most successful pre-war team of the three professional clubs in historic Lincolnshire, being the only one to play top-flight English football. It is also the only club of the three to reach an FA Cup semi-final (doing so on two occasions, both times during the 1930's). It has also spent more time in the English game's first and second tiers than any other club from Lincolnshire. Notable former managers include Bill Shankly, who went on to guide Liverpool to three League titles, two FA Cups and a UEFA Cup triumph, and Lawrie McMenemy who, after securing promotion to the then Third Division in 1972, moved to Southampton where he won the FA Cup in 1976. Alan Buckley is the club's most successful manager; he had three spells between 1988 and 2008, guiding the club to three promotions and two appearances at Wembley Stadium during the 1997–98 season, winning both the Football League Trophy and the Football League Second Division play-off Final. In 2008 Buckley took Grimsby to the capital again, but lost out to MK Dons in the final of the Football League Trophy. The Mariners had also reached the Football League Two play-off Final in 2006 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, but lost the match 1–0 to Cheltenham Town, Later trips to Wembley in 2013 and 2016 saw them defeated in the FA Trophy final by Wrexham and F.C. Halifax Town respectively, having also lost at the venue in the 2015 National League play-off final to Bristol Rovers before finally gaining promotion by winning the 2016 final against Forest Green Rovers. In 2021, relegation to the National League was confirmed for a second time, following a 3-2 defeat at Exeter City.\r\n\r\nGrimsby Town's relegation in 2010 made them the fourth club to compete in all top five divisions of English football (after Carlisle United, Oxford United and Luton Town, and before Leyton Orient and Notts County). Grimsby's 1939 FA Cup semi-final attendance of 76,962 versus Wolverhampton Wanderers is still a record at Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium. In 1954 they became the first English club to appoint a foreign manager, Hungarian Elemér Berkessy. The club's record appearance holder is John McDermott, who made 754 appearances between 1987 and 2007, while their leading scorer is Pat Glover, with 180 goals (1930–39).",

The team will compete in League One, the third tier of the English football league system, after gaining promotion at the end of the 2018–19 season.\r\n\r\nThe name Milton Keynes Dons was registered in June 2004 after Wimbledon F.C., formed in 1889, had been based at the National Hockey Stadium in Milton Keynes for nine months. The club kept its place in the English league structure after changing its name, kit and logo, competing as MK Dons from the start of the 2004–05 season. The club abandoned its claim to any history before 2004 in October 2006 as part of an agreement with the Football Supporters' Federation, which had previously boycotted the team and its supporters' groups. Under this deal MK Dons transferred Wimbledon F.C.'s trophies and other patrimony to Merton Council in south London in 2007.\r\n\r\nMK Dons were relegated to the fourth-tier League Two at the end of the 2005–06 season. Under the management of Paul Ince, the club won the 2007–08 League Two title, thereby gaining promotion back to League One, and the Football League Trophy during the same year. The team has remained in League One since the 2008–09 season and has been managed by Karl Robinson since 2010. The club has built a strong reputation for youth development—since 2004 it has given first team debuts to 14 local academy graduates.",

Il Milton Keynes Dons è dunque legalmente una continuazione del Wimbledon, anche se, dopo lunghe negoziazioni con le associazioni di tifosi del Wimbledon, il nuovo club ha accettato di restituire tutti i trofei e cimeli del Wimbledon al London Borough of Merton, accettando altresì di non rivendicare alcun legame con la storia del Wimbledon.",

The team competes in League One, the third tier of the English football league system following promotion via the play offs in the 2020–21 season. Nicknamed the \"Shrimps\" due to the coastal town's local speciality food, the club have played home games at the Mazuma Stadium since moving from their original home at Christie Park in 2010. The club contests rivalries with nearby Accrington Stanley, as well as other Lancashire clubs.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1920 and entered into the Lancashire Combination, where they would remain for the next 48 years, winning the league title on five occasions: 1924–25, 1961–62, 1962–63, 1966–67 and 1967–68. They joined the newly formed Northern Premier League in 1968 and went on to win the FA Trophy in 1974 and the Northern Premier League President's Cup in 1992. Under the stewardship of Jim Harvey, a second-place finish in the 1994–95 Northern Premier League Premier Division season saw them promoted into the Conference. Having been beaten in the 2003 and 2006 play-off semi-finals, Sammy McIlroy led the club to promotion into the Football League with victory in the 2007 play-off final. Since that time, they only finished in the top ten of League Two twice, reaching the play-off semi-finals after fourth-place finishes in 2009–10 and 2020–21; however, the latter season saw them book a place in the League Two play-off final and their first-ever promotion to League One. They, along with AFC Wimbledon, are the only teams in the top four levels of the English game never to have been relegated in their entire history.",

Formed on 28 November 1862, Notts County are the oldest football team in the world to currently play at a professional level. Between 1888–89 and 2013–14 they played a total of 4,756 Football League matches – more than any other English team. \r\nCounty play their home games at Meadow Lane in black and white striped shirts.\r\n\r\nThe club has had several spells in the top division of English football, most recently in 1991–92, when County played in the old First Division. Notable former managers of Notts County include Jimmy Sirrel, Howard Wilkinson, Neil Warnock, Howard Kendall and Sam Allardyce. The club has had several owners. In the 21st century, a series of financial problems has seen the club owned by a Supporters' trust, who sold the club to Munto Finance – a subsidiary of Qadbak Investments. Further monetary difficulties saw the club sold, for a nominal fee, to Peter Trembling, who then sold the club to Ray Trew for £1 after the club had been served with two winding up petitions from HM Revenue and Customs due to demands for a late PAYE payment of around £500,000.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Port Vale Football Club is a football club in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, England, which plays in League One, the third tier of the English football league system.\r\n\r\nPort Vale is one of the few English league clubs not to be named after a geographical location, their name being a reference to the valley of ports on the Trent and Mersey Canal. They were founder members of the Second Division in 1892 and of the Fourth Division in 1958. After playing at the Athletic Ground in Cobridge and The Old Recreation Ground in Hanley, the club returned to Burslem when Vale Park was opened in 1950. Outside the ground is a statue to Roy Sproson who played 842 competitive games for the club.\r\n\r\nThe club greatest success was in the 1950s when they were FA Cup semi-finalists in 1954 and won two divisional titles with Freddie Steele's \"Iron Curtain\" defence and then Norman Low's more attacking style. John Rudge was manager from 1983 to 1999; under his leadership the club reached eighth in the second tier in the 1996–97 season. Since his reign the club have declined, slipping into the fourth tier whilst entering administration in 2003 and 2012. The decline was arrested when Paul Wildes and Norman Smurthwaite bought the club out of Administration in 2012 and manager Micky Adams achieved automatic promotion from League Two in the 2012–13 season.\r\n\r\nThe club's traditional rivals are Stoke City, and games between the two are known as the Potteries derby. However, with Stoke City in the Premier League, rivalry has increased between Port Vale and other clubs, including Burton Albion, Macclesfield Town, Shrewsbury Town, Walsall, Wrexham, and Crewe Alexandra.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Swindon Town Football Club is a professional football club based in Swindon, Wiltshire, England. The team currently competes in League One, the third tier of the English football league system. They will be relegated to League Two for the 2021-22 season after finishing 23rd in the 2020-21 campaign. The club has played home matches at the County Ground since 1896, which now boasts a capacity of 15,728. Known as the \"Robins\", their home colours are red and white. Hall of Fame inductee John Trollope played 770 league games for the club between 1960 and 1980, a professional record in English football.\r\n\r\nFounded as Swindon AFC in 1879, they became Spartans the next year, before finally settling on the name Swindon Town in 1883. The club turned professional in 1894 as a founding member of the Southern League, later also entering the Western League between 1897 and 1902. They were crowned Western League champions in 1898–99 and Southern League champions in 1910–11 and 1913–14, before they were elected into the Football League in 1920. They remained in the third tier for 43 years, finally securing promotion into the Second Division in 1962–63, where they remained for just two seasons. They lifted the League Cup after beating Arsenal in the 1969 final, and went on to secure promotion at the end of the 1968–69 season with the help of talismanic winger Don Rogers. Relegated again in 1973–74, they dropped into the fourth tier for the first time at the end of the 1981–82 season.\r\n\r\nSwindon won the Fourth Division title in 1985–86 and secured a second successive promotion the following season under the stewardship of Lou Macari. They went on to claim victory in the 1990 Second Division play-off final, but were denied promotion into the top-flight after admitting to breaching Football League regulations. Glenn Hoddle coached the team to victory in the 1993 play-off final to finally secure a place in the top-flight for the first time in the club's history. However they were relegated out of the Premier League at the end of the 1993–94 season and dropped into the third tier with a second consecutive relegation. Promoted again as champions to avoid an FA expulsion and a hat-trick of relegations in 1995–96, they remained in the second tier for four seasons until relegation in 2000. They dropped into League Two in 2006, though managed to secure promotion the next season; they repeated this feat following relegation in 2011, winning the League Two title in 2011–12 to earn promotion to League One. They repeated the feat from the 1981–82 season by following relegation back to League Two at the end of the 2016–17 season. They won their third League Two title in the COVID-19 pandemic-stricken 2019–20 season.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Tranmere Rovers Football Club is a professional association football club based in Birkenhead, Merseyside, England. Founded in 1884 as Belmont Football Club, they adopted their current name in 1885. They were a founder member of Division Three North in 1921, and were a member of The Football League until 2015, when they were relegated to the National League, the fifth tier of English football. They returned to the Football League in 2018, and were promoted to EFL League One in 2019.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1980s, they were beset by financial problems and, in 1987, went into administration. However, this was a prelude to the most successful period in Tranmere's history; under manager John King, the team reached the play-offs for promotion to the Premier League in three successive seasons. Under King's successor, John Aldridge, Tranmere experienced a number of cup runs, most notably reaching the 2000 Football League Cup Final. Other cup runs include reaching FA Cup quarter-finals in 2000, 2001 and 2004.\r\n\r\nTranmere's regular kit is an all-white strip with blue trim, their main colours since 1962. The club moved to its current home, Prenton Park, in 1912. In 1995, the ground had a major redevelopment in response to the Taylor Report. It now seats 16,567 in four stands: the Main Stand, the Kop, the Johnny King Stand and the Cowshed.",
