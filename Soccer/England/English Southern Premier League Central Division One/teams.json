            "strDescriptionEN": "Beaconsfield Town Football Club is a football club based in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, England. They are currently members of the Southern League Premier Division South and play at Holloways Park.\r\n\r\nThe club was established as Beaconsfield SYCOB in 1994 by a merger of Beaconsfield United of the Spartan League and Slough Youth Club Old Boys of the Chiltonian League, with the new club taking Beaconsfield United's place in the Premier Division of the Spartan League; Beaconsfield United had played in the Spartan League since 1979 and won the Senior Division in 1982–83, earning promotion to the Premier Division, whilst Slough Youth Club Old Boys had been members of the Chiltonian League since 1990. When the league merged with the South Midlands League to form the Spartan South Midlands League in 1997, Beaconsfield were placed in the Premier South Division, finishing as runners-up in the league's first season and earning a place in the Premier Division for the following season.\r\n\r\nIn 2000–01 Beaconsfield won the Premier Division. After repeating this in 2003–04 they were promoted to Division One East of the Southern League. They were transferred to Division One West for the following season, which became Division One South & West for the 2006–07 season. However, after finishing bottom of the division that season, they were relegated back to the Spartan South Midlands League. The club won the league at the first attempt, and were promoted back to Division One South & West of the Southern League. The following season, 2008–09, saw them finish fourth, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. However, they lost 2–1 to AFC Totton in the semi-finals.\r\n\r\nIn 2009 Beaconsfield were transferred to Division One Midlands, which became Division One Central the following season. A fifth-place finish in 2011–12 saw them qualify for the play-offs again, this time losing 3–1 in the final to Bedworth United after beating local rivals Slough Town 2–1 in the semi-finals. Another fifth-place finish the following season led to another play-off campaign, but they were beaten 1–0 by Rugby Town in the semi-finals. In 2017 the club changed its name to Beaconsfield Town, two years after the move was first announced. The 2017–18 season saw them win the renamed East Division, earning promotion to the Premier South division.",

The club plays its home matches at Woodside Park in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, which it shares with owners Bishop's Stortford F.C. Traditionally based in Enfield, Greater London, the club was, between the 1960s and 1980s, one of the most successful non-league clubs in England, winning the FA Amateur Cup, FA Trophy and Football Conference twice. The club, however, did not manage to gain election to the Football League. Following financial struggles and the sale of their Southbury Road stadium, the club declined, eventually folding and reforming in 2007 as Enfield 1893 F.C., later dropping the 1893 suffix in 2019.",
