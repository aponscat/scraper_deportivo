After three seasons, they moved to the Spartan League and finished as runners-up in the 1974–75 season. The following year, they became founder members of the London Spartan League after a merger of their existing league merged with the Metropolitan-London League. Chertsey Town joined the Athenian League a year later and remained until the league disbanded in 1984. They subsequently joined the Isthmian League but immediately suffered relegation to the Combined Counties League. The club returned at the first time of asking as runners-up, and in 1986 began a 20 season stay in the Isthmian League, achieving three promotions and three relegations across the divisions.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, the Curfews returned to the Combined Counties League with a restructuring of the non-league pyramid and regularly finished in the top half of the table. In 2011, Chertsey Town finished as runners-up and were promoted to the Southern League Division One Central after a dispute over the suitability of the league winner's ground for the higher division. However, the club struggled for three seasons before suffering relegation back to the Combined Counties League. In the 2018–19 season, the Curfews won the Combined Counties League Premier Division with just three defeats and were crowned FA Vase winners at Wembley Stadium. The club returned to the Isthmian League in 2019 but saw the first two seasons curtailed.",

The club have moved back to the National League North for the 2019\/20 season. Previously it competed in the National League North from 2009 to 2017 and then spent two seasons in the National League South afterwards. Prior to that, it spent a record 70 years within the Southern Football League from 1939 until 2009. The club secured promotion after a playoff final win against Farnborough.\r\n\r\nIn July 2007, the club was considerably affected by the 2007 United Kingdom floods, which significantly affected Gloucestershire. and left the Meadow Park stadium under eight feet of water. The impact of the flooding has meant that the club has been in exile away from Gloucester ever since. The Tigers have played home games at Cheltenham Town's Whaddon Road, after spending three seasons sharing at Cirencester Town's Corinium Stadium and Forest Green Rovers' New Lawn stadium in Nailsworth. From the 2017–18 season, the club has played at Evesham United whilst construction continues on a new stadium on the old Meadow Park site.\r\n\r\nThe club received full planning permission from Gloucester City Council to build a new 3,060 capacity stadium, raised by several feet, on the site of their former home of Meadow Park with plans to expand to over 4,000. A revised plan was submitted in October 2018 however to retain the use of a former building and some alterations to the layout. This was approved by Gloucester City Council on 7 May.\r\n\r\nThe club is currently managed by James Rowe, who has been manager since November 2019. The club is affiliated to the Gloucestershire County FA.",

They compete in the Southern League Premier Division South and play their home matches at their Wordsworth Drive ground which they moved into during the 1953 season. The club is affiliated to the Somerset County FA.\r\n\r\nAfter being formed in 1947, they were admitted into the Western League in 1954. They struggled over the next ten years, and it was not until the 1970s that the club started to prosper. Having won the Western League in 1968–69, the club then finished as runners-up in the same league in four successive seasons from 1973. They gained promotion to the Southern League in 1977 and purchased their ground from the local council. In the early 1980s they dropped back down into the Western League for financial reasons, but did not enjoy further success until 1989–90. The following twelve seasons saw the club win the title on four more occasions (1995–96, 1998–99, 1999–2000 and 2000–01) and finish as runners-up four times (1993–94, 1996–97, 1997–98 and 2001–02).\r\n\r\nIn 2001 the club won the FA Vase, which it had narrowly missed out on seven years earlier. Following their string of good results, Taunton rejoined the Southern League for the 2002–03 season. After the latest re-organisation of the English football league system, the club are currently members of the Southern League Premier Division South.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Tiverton Town Football Club are an English football club based in Tiverton, Devon. The club are currently members of the Southern League Premier Division South and play at Ladysmead.\r\n\r\nThe club was established in 1913 as Tiverton Athletic, and initially played at the Athletic Ground. They joined the East Devon League, winning the Senior Division in 1924–25, 1925–26, 1926–27 and 1927–28. They then joined the North Devon League, winning it in 1931–32, after which they transferred to the Exeter & District League, which they won in 1933–34.\r\n\r\nIn 1951–52 the club won the league's Senior Division, and in 1956 won the Devon Senior Cup for the first time. They won the league again in 1964–65 and 1965–66, a season in which they also won the Senior Cup for a second time.\r\n\r\nIn 1973 the club joined the Western League. They were relegated to Division One at the end of the 1980–81 season after finishing bottom of the league. After finishing as runners-up in 1988–89, they were promoted back to the Premier Division. Following two fourth-placed finishes, the club finished third in 1991–92, second in 1992–93 (a season in which they also won the League Cup for the first time), and won the league and League Cup double in 1993–94. They won the league again the following season, and after finishing as runners-up in 1995–96, a season in which they also picked up the League Cup, achieved back-to-back titles again in 1996–97 (a double season) and 1997–98. They also won the FA Vase in 1998, beating Tow Law Town 1–0 in the final.\r\n\r\nIn 1998–99 the club won the FA Vase again, beating Bedlington Terriers 1–0, and finished second in the league, earning promotion to Division One West of the Southern League. In 2000–01 they finished second, and were promoted to the Premier Division, where they remained until 2011. In 2006–07 they won the Southern League Cup.\r\n\r\nOn 18 April 2012 it was announced in the national press that Tiverton had appointed 27-year-old internet entrepreneur Matthew Conridge as their new chairman. Believed to be one of the youngest football chairman in the UK ever Conridge was quoted as saying, \"I'm not here to chuck thousands of pounds into a black hole, I'm here to pull everyone together and work with a good team......This club will not spend more than it can afford to chase a dream......If we can't afford a budget to go to Blue Square Bet South we won't pay it\".\r\n\r\nOn 30 April 2013 Tiverton Town released a press release as follows \"Tiverton Town can confirm that Matthew Conridge has stepped down as Chairman of Tiverton Town to pursue other business interests. The club would like to place on record its gratitude for all his hard work whilst in the position. Former Tivvy chairman Dave Wright is taking over the position of chairman for the time being. The club also wishes to confirm the departure of interim manager Jamie Ward together with his assistant Paul Short.\"\r\n\r\nIn May 2013 Tiverton town released the following press release to announce the arrival of John Clarkson as their new manager \"John Clarkson was tonight introduced to the media and Tivvy fans at a press conference at Ladysmead. Clarkson has arrived from Spain where he was manager of Ontinyent in Segunda B. He had been managing in Spain for the last six years\".\r\n\r\nIn May 2014, Tiverton Town manager John Clarkson stepped down from the position following the teams disappointing 2–0 Devon Bowl Final defeat to Plymouth Parkway who were playing in the league below Tiverton. He had led the side to the play-off's, where they lost to 9-man Paulton, and two Cup finals but cited the last couple of months as the reason he was going, \"The last couple of months have really taken it out of me, three or four games a week was just too much\" He added,\"I'm off to take my coaching badges during the summer and once I've completed them I will decide on what I'm going to do\" Despite a much higher wage budget than other teams in the league (due to John Clarkson's financial input) the club could not reach its aim of promotion in its centenary season. At the end of the season many of the club's higher profile players left following John Clarkson's resignation and the reduction of the wage budget. Yellows legend Martyn Rogers was named as Clarkson's replacement and given the task of rebuilding the squad on a much more restricted wage budget.\r\n\r\nIn the 2016\/17 season Tiverton Town gained promotion to the Southern League Premier Division. They beat Salisbury 0–2 with goals from Michael Landricombe and Tom Bath in the playoff final in front of over 2,000, returning them to the Southern League Premier after being relegated in 2011.\r\n\r\nIn the 2017\/18 season following promotion from the 8th teir Tivvy finished in a highly respectable position of 6th. Especially considering the low budget and crowds compared to the top 5 and most of the league. However despite this Tivvy managed to beat 4 of the top 5 with playoff hopes ending due to poor away form.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Walton & Hersham Football Club is a semi-professional football club based in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey. Founded in 1945 following the amalgamation of Walton FC and Hersham FC, they currently play in the Isthmian League South Central Division. The club is affiliated to the Surrey County Football Association.\r\n\r\nThe club joined the Corinthian League upon formation, and after a difficult first season won three consecutive league titles. In 1950, the club moved to the Athenian League, and were later placed in the Premier Division upon expansion in 1963. Walton & Hersham were named league champions for a fourth time during the 1968–69 season, and shortly after joined the Isthmian League. The club's most successful period soon followed, which saw them reach the FA Cup Second Round and win the FA Amateur Cup at Wembley Stadium, although the departure of manager Allen Batsford and several players to Wimbledon saw the club quickly relegated to the Isthmian League Division Two.\r\n\r\nAfter coming close to extinction in the late 1970s, former Ballon d'Or winner Sir Stanley Matthews was briefly named as president and the club later managed to find consistency throughout the 1980s. The Swans regularly earned promotion and suffered relegation between the Isthmian League divisions throughout the next decades, and named Millwall chairman Theo Paphitis as a board member for several years. Following the 2015–16 season, the club suffered relegation to the Combined Counties Premier Division and began to struggle once again.\r\n\r\nIn August 2017, Walton & Hersham left Stompond Lane and moved into the Elmbridge Sports Hub – a £20 million sports complex development shared with local rivals Walton Casuals. After three seasons in the ninth tier of English football, the club suffered further relegation to the Combined Counties Division One and long-term owner Alan Smith stepped down from his position. In July 2019, the club was taken over by a group of students, who claim to be the youngest owners in world football.\r\n\r\nWalton & Hersham are the inspiration behind the name of punk band Sham 69, which was derived from a piece of graffiti reading 'Walton & Hersham 69'.",
