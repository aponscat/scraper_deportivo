            "strDescriptionEN": "Ascot United Football Club is a football club based in Ascot, Berkshire, England. They are currently members of the Combined Counties League Premier Division and play at Ascot Racecourse.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nThe club was founded in 1965. In 2001 they joined the Senior Division of the Reading League, going on to win the league in 2006–07. As a result, the club were promoted to Division One East of the Hellenic League. After finishing fourth in their first season, they claimed the runners-up spot in 2008–09 season, earning promotion to the Premier Division. The club made its debut in the FA Vase in the 2010–11 season and the 2011–12 season saw them play in the FA Cup for the first time. Their first match was against Wembley, which was the first-ever FA Cup match streamed live on Facebook. The game also led to Ascot's record attendance of 1,149. In 2013–14 the club won the Hellenic League Challenge Cup, defeating Ardley United 2–1 in the final. The 2018–19 season saw them win the Challenge Cup for a second time with a 3–1 win against Windsor in the final. At the end of the season they were transferred to the Premier Division of the Combined Counties League.\r\n\r\nGround\r\nThe club originally played home matches at Sunninghill, but were given permission by the Ascot Racecourse trustees to build a ground on land to the north of a coach park at the racecourse. A clubhouse was built, which was replaced in 1990, and again in 1992. Two years later floodlights were also installed. The ground now has a capacity of 1,150.",

They play in the Bostik Isthmian League Premier Division. The club is affiliated to the Surrey County Football Association and is a FA Charter Standard club\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1907 as Leatherhead Rose, and originally played friendlies. In 1909 they joined the Dorking and District League, and won the league at the first attempt. After the First World War the team rejoined that league and again won the league championship. The following season they joined the Kingston and District League, and went on to win three league titles before the Second World War.\r\n\r\nLeatherhead also had another local club, Leatherhead United, formed in 1924, who won Division One of the Sutton and District League in the 1925–26 season. United also finished third in the Premier League in the 1928–29 season, behind Leatherhead Rose who were runners-up. In the early 1930s Fetcham Grove-based United joined the Surrey Junior League and became Champions at the end of the 1933–34 season. This enabled United to join the Surrey Intermediate League, but they were relegated after a few seasons at the end of the 1936–37 campaign.\r\n\r\nAfter the Second World War officials of the two clubs met; and on 27 May 1946 Leatherhead Football Club was officially formed at a public meeting. The two clubs pooled their financial resources and chose United's Fetcham Grove ground for their home pitch. The club then joined the Surrey Senior League for the start of the 1946–47 season.\r\n\r\nThey won that league four times in a row, and left the league to join the Metropolitan & District League for the 1950–51 season. The next season they became founding members of the Delphian League. The team played in the Delphian League for seven seasons before joining the Corinthian League. In the 1962–63 season they became the last ever Corinthian League champions, as the league was disbanded. Along with most of the other sides, they joined the enlarged Athenian League in the new Division One. At the end of their first season in Division One they were promoted to the Premier Division as Champions.",
