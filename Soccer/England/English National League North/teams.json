            "strDescriptionEN": "Darlington Football Club is an English football club based in Darlington, County Durham. They are members of the National League North, the sixth tier of English football, and play at Blackwell Meadows.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1883, and played its matches at Feethams. The club originally played in regionally organised leagues, and were one of the founding members of the Northern League in 1889. They were first admitted to the Football League when the Third Division North was formed in 1921. They won the Third Division North title in 1925, and their 15th place in the Second Division in 1926 remains their highest ever league finish. After their admission to the League, they spent most of their history in the bottom tier. They won the Third Division North Cup in 1934, their first victory in nationally organised cup competition. They reached the last 16 of the FA Cup twice, and the quarter-final of the Football League Cup once, in 1968. In the early 1990s they won successive titles, in the Conference National in 1990 and the Fourth Division in 1991. In 2011 they won the FA Trophy, defeating Mansfield Town 1â€“0 at Wembley Stadium.\r\n\r\nDarlington moved to the all-seater, 25,000-capacity Darlington Arena in 2003. The cost of the stadium was a major factor in driving the club into administration in 2012. Because the club was unable to agree a Creditors Voluntary Agreement (CVA) it was expelled from the Football Association (FA). A new club was immediately formed but the FA ruled that, as a new club, it must have a different playing name from the expelled club. The name chosen was Darlington 1883, and that club was placed in the Northern League Division One, the ninth tier of English football, for the 2012â€“13 season. They won three promotions in four seasons before the FA approved their request to change to the traditional Darlington FC name.\r\n\r\nThe club's traditional colours are black and white shirts, black shorts and black and white socks. The club's crest depicts Locomotion No. 1, referring to the town's railway history; as well as a stylised Quaker hat, referring to the religious movement that had a historic influence on the town, and which was the source of the team's nickname, the Quakers.\r\n\r\nThe club's main rival historically has been Hartlepool United.",

They are currently members of the National League, the fifth tier of English football, and play at the Walks.\r\n\r\nThe club was established in 2010 after King's Lynn F.C. were wound up in 2009. They were admitted to the Premier Division of the United Counties League and were runners-up in their first season in the league, also reaching the semi-finals of the FA Vase, where they lost 6â€“2 on aggregate to Coalville Town. After finishing as runners-up again in 2011â€“12 the club were promoted to Division One South of the Northern Premier League. They won Division One South at the first attempt, earning promotion to the Premier Division. In 2015 the club were transferred to the Premier Division of the Southern League. In 2016â€“17 they won the Norfolk Senior Cup, beating Fakenham Town 2â€“0 in the final. The club were runners-up in the Southern League Premier Division in 2017â€“18, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. After beating Weymouth 3â€“0 in the semi-finals, they lost 2â€“1 to Slough Town in the final. The club were placed in the Premier Division Central for the 2018â€“19 season, going on to finish as runners-up and qualifying for the play-offs. After defeating Stratford Town and Alvechurch, they were promoted to the National League North following a 3â€“2 win against Warrrington Town in the super play-off final.\r\n\r\nThe 2019â€“20 season was abandoned due to the coronavirus pandemic with the club second in the league, two points behind leaders York City with two games in hand. The National League later decided the final league table would be based on points-per-game, resulting in King's Lynn being declared champions, earning promotion to the national division.",

The team compete in League Two, the fourth tier of the English football league system.\r\n\r\nThe team is nicknamed The Iron, and has played in a home strip of claret and blue for most of its history. It plays its home games at Glanford Park, having moved from the Old Show Ground in 1988. Grimsby Town, Hull City, Doncaster Rovers, Lincoln City and York City are its main rivals, although Doncaster are the only one of these clubs that currently plays in Scunthorpe's division. It is currently the only league club located in Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\nThe club was formed in 1899, turned professional in 1912 and joined the Football League in 1950. It achieved promotion to Division Two in 1958, where it stayed until 1964, but has spent most of its time as a Football League club in the basement tier. The club has had more success recently, however: it was promoted from Football League Two in 2005, and has spent three of the last five seasons in the Football League Championship. The Iron were relegated to Football League One in 2011, having finished bottom of the Championship.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the club has developed a reputation for developing promising young strikers, having sold Billy Sharp, Martin Paterson and Gary Hooper on for seven-figure sums. The club was also considered one of the most financially prudent in English football, being one of only three in the top four divisions to be debt-free. This status has recently changed after it was announced that a Â£2 million loan from the outgoing chairman Steve Wharton was on the accounts to help the club maintain some sense of financial stability.",

They play their home matches at Haig Avenue, currently called the Merseyrail Community Stadium for sponsorship reasons, which has a capacity of 6,008 (1,660 seated, 4,164 standing). They are known by their nickname \"the Sandgrounders\". The club's main honour is winning the 1972â€“73 Football League Fourth Division Championship and they have won a number of titles in non-league football.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1881, the club were members of regional leagues such as the Lancashire League, the Lancashire Combination and The Central League for many years until 1921 when they were invited to become a founding member of the newly formed Football League Third Division North. Southport held membership of The Football League from 1921 to 1978. They failed to gain re-election in 1978 and since then have been members of the Northern Premier League (1978 to 1993), the Football Conference (1993 to 2003) and then the Northern Premier League Premier Division for its final season (2003â€“04). Southport were transferred to the new National League North in 2004 and, since then, have played in either that division (tier 6) or the tier 5 National League. In 2017, Southport were relegated from tier 5 to tier 6 and currently (2017â€“18) they are again playing in the National League North.\r\n\r\nSouthport first participated in the FA Cup in the 1882â€“83 tournament. Their best performance was in the 1930â€“31 tournament when they reached the quarter-finals (last eight) but were then beaten 9â€“1 by Everton at Goodison Park. Southport had another good FA Cup run in 1965â€“66 when they reached the fifth round (last sixteen) and were beaten 2â€“0 by Hull City at Boothferry Park. Southport took part in the Football League Cup from 1960 to 1978 but never progressed beyond the first two rounds. The team reached the final of the FA Trophy in 1997â€“98, played at the old Wembley Stadium, but lost 1â€“0 to Cheltenham Town.",
