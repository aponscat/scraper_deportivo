            "strDescriptionEN": "Bognor Regis Town Football Club is an English football club based in Bognor Regis, West Sussex. The club is an FA Chartered Standard Community club affiliated to the Sussex County Football Association. They currently compete in the Isthmian League Premier Division.\r\n\r\nBognor F.C. were founded in 1883 and the club became founding members of the West Sussex Football League in 1896, joining the Senior Division. They won the championship of this league for five successive years in the early 1920s, after which they joined the Brighton & Hove District League in 1926. Just one year later, however, they joined the Sussex County League where they were to remain until 1972. The club became Bognor Regis F.C. in 1929 after King George V added the suffix 'Regis' to the seaside resort.\r\n\r\nThe club won the Sussex County Division One championship in the 1948–49 season. At the end of that season, they added \"Town\" to their name so as not to be confused with the local rugby club.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the 1969–70 season they were relegated, but won Division Two at the first attempt. The club won the Division One championship title the following season and were promoted to Division One South of the Southern League. In 1972–73 they reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 6–0 at Colchester United. In 1976 Jack Pearce became manager at the age of just 26, and went on to hold the position until 2007.\r\n\r\nIn 1981 the club were transferred to Division One of the Isthmian League, and were promoted at the end of the 1981–82 season after finishing second. In 1984–85 they reached the first round of the FA Cup again, beating Swansea City 3–1 in a replay after a 1–1 draw at the Vetch Field. In the second round they lost 5–2 at Reading. They reached the second round again the following season, beating Enfield in the first round, before losing 6–1 at Gillingham. They went on to reach the first round again in 1986–87 (losing 1–0 in a replay to Slough Town) and 1987–88 (losing 3–0 at home to Torquay United). In 1988–89 they beat Football League opposition again, defeating Exeter City 2–1, before losing to Cambridge United.\r\n\r\nIn 1991–92 Bognor finished in the relegation zone, but were reprieved after Dagenham and Redbridge Forest merged. However, the following season they finished bottom of the Premier Division, and were relegated to Division One. In 1995–96 they reached the second round of the FA Cup for a fourth time, before losing 4–0 at Peterborough United.\r\n\r\nIn 2002–03 they finished second in Division One South, and were promoted back to the Premier Division. After finishing tenth the following year, the club were placed in the newly established Conference South. They were relegated back to the Isthmian League Premier Division at the end of the 2008–09 season, and were relegated again the following season.\r\n\r\nSeason 2010–11 saw the club compete in the Isthmian League Division One South and they missed out on promotion back to the Premier Division by the tightest of margins. Having finished with a club record total of 96 points, they lost out in the title race to Metropolitan Police on goal difference by just one goal, having led the table by two points, going in to the last fixture. As a result, they found themselves having to participate in the end-of-season play-offs, where they lost at home to Dulwich Hamlet who had finished 31 points behind.\r\n\r\nIn 2011–12 they again finished second in Division One South. They won the end-of-season play-offs, defeating Godalming Town in a thrilling semi-final, before beating Dulwich Hamlet 1–0 in the final, and thus gaining promotion to the Premier Division. The 2013-14 season started slowly with just one point from the opening four matches. However they soon rose up the table, eventually finishing in third place and qualified for the end of season play-offs, although this ended in defeat in the semi-final at home to Lowestoft Town.\r\n\r\nSeason 2015-16 saw them miss out on the Premier Division title by one point and then lose in the play-offs to Dulwich Hamlet. They did however, also enjoy their best ever run in the FA Trophy by reaching the semi-finals. They beat a number of teams from higher divisions along the way, including Bath City, Maidstone United, Altrincham, Sutton United and Torquay United. But hopes of an appearance at Wembley Stadium were dashed when they were defeated in the semi-final by Grimsby Town, losing 1-0 in the first leg at Nyewood Lane, before also losing the second leg 2-1 at Blundell Park (3-1 on aggregate), despite putting up spirited displays in both legs.\r\n\r\nSeason 2016-17 saw them finish in second place for the second season running, but this time they triumphed in the play-offs, beating Wingate & Finchley in the semi-final, before victory over Dulwich Hamlet in the final, to win promotion to the National League South for season 2017-18. However, despite a promising start to life in the Vanarama South in 2017-18, they eventually finished bottom of the table and as a result, returned to the Isthmian Premier for season 2018-19. They spent much of the 2018-19 in play-off contention but a dip in form in the last couple of months saw them eventually finish in 14th place. However, there was something to celebrate at the end of the season as they won the Sussex Senior Cup for the first time in 32 years, defeating Burgess Hill Town in the final played at Falmer Stadium, Brighton.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Dover Athletic Football Club is an association football club based in the town of Dover, Kent, England. The club currently competes in the National League, the fifth tier of English football. The club was formed in 1983 after the dissolution of the town's previous club, Dover F.C., whose place in the Southern League was taken by the new club. In the 1989–90 season Dover Athletic won the Southern League championship, but failed to gain promotion to the Football Conference as the club's ground did not meet the required standard. Three seasons later the team won the title again and this time gained promotion to the Conference, where they spent nine seasons before being relegated at the end of the 2001–02 season. The club was transferred from the Southern League to the Isthmian League in 2004, competing in that league's Premier Division for one season before mounting financial problems led the club to a further relegation. In the 2007–08 season, Dover won Division One South of the league, before winning the Premier Division in 2008–09 and thus gaining promotion to the Conference South. They spent five seasons in this division, reaching the play-offs three times, before defeating Ebbsfleet United in the 2013–14 play-off final to finally return to the Conference Premier after a twelve-year absence.\r\n\r\nThe team usually wear white shirts and are consequently nicknamed the Whites. They have played at the Crabble Athletic Ground since the club's formation. The club's best performance in the FA Cup was reaching the third round proper in both the 2010–11 and 2014–15 seasons, while the best performance registered in the FA Trophy, the national competition for higher-level non-league clubs, was a run to the semi-finals in the 1997–98 season.",

They won Division One in 1969–70 and were Division One runners-up in 1976–77 before going on to win the Premier Division in 1978–79. The Premier Division was renamed the Senior Division in 1984. The town's main club, Folkestone, folded in 1990, and after a third-place finish in 1990–91, Invicta joined Division Two of the Kent League, which was largely composed of reserve teams. They went on to win the division, as well as the Division Two Cup and the Kent Intermediate Shield in the 1991–92 season, and were promoted to Division One.\r\n\r\nFolkestone were runners-up in Division One of the Kent League in 1997–98, earning promotion to the Southern Division of the Southern League.

The club spent three seasons in the Premier Division, before finishing bottom of the table in 2002–03, after which they were relegated to the Eastern Division.

The club spent four seasons in the Isthmian League Premier Division before relegation to Division One South at the end of the 2008–09 season. In 2009–10 they were runners-up in Division One South, having missed out on the title due to having ten points deducted for going into administration. However, they qualified for the promotion play-offs, and after beating Leatherhead on penalties in the semi-finals, they defeated Godalming Town 2–1 in the final, earning promotion back to the Premier Division. In the following season the club finished bottom of the Premier Division and the club were relegated straight back to Division One South.\r\n\r\nThe next four seasons saw Folkestone finish in the top five, qualifying for the promotion play-offs; in 2011–12 they lost 2–1 to Dulwich Hamlet in the semi-finals and in 2012–13 they lost at the same stage to Maidstone United.

They reached the final again in 2014–15 after defeating Whyteleafe in the semi-finals, but were beaten 3–0 in the final by Merstham. After four successive play-off failures, the club won Division One South in 2015–16 to return to the Premier Division. They finished fourth in the Premier Division in 2017–18, going on to lose 4–0 in the play-off semi-finals to Hendon.",

They went on to become founder members of the Sussex County Football League in 1920, changing their name to Hastings & St Leonards in 1921, before leaving to join the Southern Amateur Football League in 1927. They had a brief stay in the Corinthian League before becoming founder members of Division Two of the Sussex County League in 1952. They changed their name to Hastings Town in 1976 and took Hastings United's place in the Southern Football League in 1985. They became Hastings United in 2002 and would go on to join the Isthmian League in 2004, where they have remained since.\r\n\r\nThe club's traditional colours are claret and blue, though for the 2017-18 season their home kit is white with claret and blue trim.

            "strDescriptionEN": "Hendon Football Club is a semi-professional football club based in Kingsbury in the London Borough of Brent. They are currently members of the Southern League Premier Division South and play at Silver Jubilee Park in Kingsbury.\r\n\r\nThe club was established as Christchurch Hampstead in 1908. They joined the Third Division of the Finchley & District League, which they won at the first attempt, earning promotion to Division Two. At the start of the 1909–10 season the club were renamed Hampstead Town and they went on to win Division Two at the first attempt, earning promotion to Division One. For the 1911–12 season the club entered teams into both Division One of the Finchley & District League and Division Two of the London League. They won the Finchley & District League title, and a fourth-place finish in Division Two of the London League saw the club promoted to Division One. They subsequently entered a team into the Middlesex League alongside the London League team.\r\n\r\nIn 1912–13 Hampstead Town were runners-up in Division One of the London League, earning promotion to the Premier Division (Amateur); they also won the Middlesex League. The following season saw them win both the Middlesex League and the Premier Division (Amateur) of the London League. This success saw the club admitted to the Athenian League for the 1914–15 season. However, the league was abandoned after two games due to World War I. After the war they played in the United Senior League in the 1918–19 season and won the league, before returning to the Athenian League when it restarted in 1919. The club was renamed Hampstead in 1926. They were Athenian League runners-up in 1928–29 and again in 1932–33, before being renamed Golders Green in 1933. They reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time in 1934–35, losing 10–1 at Third Division South Southend United. In 1946 the club was renamed again, adopting its current name, that of a club that existed in the 19th century.\r\n\r\nHendon were Athenian League runners-up in 1947–48, 1948–49 and 1951–52 before winning their first Athenian League title in 1952–53, a season which also saw them reach the first round of the FA Cup again, losing 2–0 at Northampton Town in a replay. In 1954–55 they reached the final of the FA Amateur Cup, losing 2–0 to Bishop Auckland at Wembley. They went on to win the Athenian League title again in 1955–56, also reaching the second round of the FA Cup, beating Halesowen Town 4–2 in the first round before losing 6–2 at Exeter City in the second. The club won their first Amateur Cup in 1959–60, defeating Kingstonian 2–1 in the final. A third Athenian League title was won in 1960–61. In 1963 the club switched to the Isthmian League. They were runners-up in their first season in the league. In their second season, 1964–65, the club won the Isthmian League and Amateur Cup double, defeating Whitby Town 3–1 in the final.\r\n\r\nHendon reached the final of the FA Amateur Cup again the following season, but lost 3–1 to Wealdstone. After winning their third Amateur Cup with a 2–0 win against Enfield in 1971–72, a second Isthmian League title was won in 1972–73. The following season they reached the third round of the FA Cup, where they drew Newcastle United; after holding them to a 1–1 draw at St James' Park, Hendon lost 4–0 in a replay played at Watford's Vicarage Road. In 1975–76 the club defeated a Football League club for the first time, beating Reading 1–0 in the first round, before losing to Swindon Town in the second round.\r\n\r\nIn 2003–04 Hendon finished fourth in the Isthmian League Premier Division but declined to join the new Conference South. Having remained in the top division of the Isthmian League since joining it in 1963, Hendon finished in the relegation zone at the end of the 2005–06 season, but were reprieved after Canvey Island's resignation from the Football Conference. During the summer of 2010, the club was bought out by the Hendon FC Supporters Trust, an Industrial and Provident Society. In 2014–15 they were Premier Division runners-up, qualifying for the promotion play-offs; after beating Metropolitan Police 2–1 in the semi-finals, they lost the final 1–0 to Margate. The 2017–18 season saw the club finish third in the Premier Division. In the subsequent play-offs, they defeated Folkestone Invicta 4–0 in the semi-finals before losing the final 4–3 on penalties to Dulwich Hamlet. The club were placed in the Premier South Division of the Southern League for the 2018–19 season as part of the restructuring of the non-League pyramid.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Horsham Football Club are a non-League football club based in Horsham, West Sussex, England, currently playing in the Isthmian League Premier Division.\r\n\r\nThe first Horsham Football Club was founded in 1871, though its existence largely depended upon enough players being available to form a side. In 1881 the club was firmly re-established, playing its first game against Dorking, and, in September 1882, helped found the Sussex County Football Association, with club official A. R. Bostock becoming one of three original Vice Presidents. Horsham became founder members of the West Sussex Football League in 1896. They went on to win the West Sussex League championship in 1899-00, 1900–01 and 1901–02, and claiming the Royal Irish Rifles Cup in 1900 by defeating the champions of the East Sussex Senior League, Hastings. After having played at both Hurst Park and Springfield Park, the club secured Queen Street as its permanent home in 1904, but some lean form over the ensuing years saw Horsham overlooked when the Sussex County League was created in 1920. The club eventually became members of that competition after winning the West Sussex Senior League for the fourth time in 1925–26.\r\n\r\nThis was a golden age for the club and the County League was won in 1932, 1933, 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938, with the team regularly scoring over one hundred goals a season. The Sussex RUR Cup was taken in 1931, 1932, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938, and the Sussex Senior Cup in 1934 and 1939. After the break brought on by hostilities, Horsham won the first post-war title in 1947, the RUR Cup in 1946, 1949 and 1951, and the Sussex Senior Cup in 1950.\r\n\r\nIn 1947–48 Horsham reached the First Round Proper of the FA Cup for the first time, taking a first-minute lead against Tommy Lawton's Notts County, before losing 9–1. For many years Horsham had been looking to test themselves at a higher level but had seentheir annual applications to join the Athenian League come to nothing. In 1951 the club changed tack and successfully applied to become members of the Metropolitan League where they were champions at the first attempt. In 1957, however, after finishing bottom of the table, they stepped down to the Corinthian League. In 1963 this league was disbanded, and Horsham were finally able to join the Athenian League.\r\n\r\nIn 1966 they reached the First Round proper of the FA Cup for a second time after defeating Hastings United 2–1 in the 4th Qualifying Round. Horsham played Swindon Town in front of a crowd of 7,134 at Queen Street. Although they lost 0–3, the day was a 'red letter day' for the club. A special temporary stand was erected at the Queen St end of the ground for the match.\r\n\r\nIn 1973, Horsham joined the Isthmian League when it expanded to two divisions. They enjoyed little success during the 1980s and early 1990s, finishing bottom of the entire league in 1993–94, but began to turn their fortunes around with a Division Three championship win in 1995–96. In 2001–02 they finished second in Division Two and were promoted to Division One South and in 2005–06 a second-place finish in that division, finishing 2nd behind champions Ramsgate on goal difference, saw them promoted to the Premier Division for the first time. That same season, Horsham reached the final of the Sussex Senior Cup for the first time since 1979, but were beaten by Lewes 3–1 after extra-time.\r\n\r\nTheir first ever season in the Premier Division, in 2006–07, saw the Hornets finish in eighth and a promotion challenge in 2007–08 again fell away to see the club end up eleventh. However, the team beat Maidenhead United 4–1 to reach the Second Round Proper of the FA Cup for the first time where two matches were played against eventual League One champions, Swansea City.\r\n\r\nHaving sold their ground for redevelopment at the end of the season, Horsham played at Worthing during 2008–09 and reached the 4th Qualifying Round of the FA Cup where they took Conference side Stevenage Borough to a replay before ending an injury-ravaged year in thirteenth place. Season 2009–10 found the club back in Horsham, having entered into a groundshare agreement with their old neighbours Horsham YMCA as their quest for a new ground continued. Financial cutbacks at the end of the 2010–11 campaign, during which they finished only 6 points clear of possible relegation back to Division One, saw Horsham part company with long serving manager John Maggs after 11 years in charge. Former Faversham Town manager, Justin Luchford, was appointed as his replacement in June 2011 but left the role in late October 2011 and was replaced by assistant, Hugo Langton. A lack of improvement in results, during which the club failed to win any of their 19 league games, saw Langton replaced by former Worthing boss Simon Colbran in March 2012 but he was unable to prevent the side from returning to Division One South. A season of stability followed, with the Hornets ending the campaign in fifteenth and claiming the Brighton Charity Cup for a second successive season but Colbran resigned his post in November 2013 with the club in 18th position. His departure led to the popular appointment of Horsham born Gary Charman, some fifteen years after making the first of more than 550 appearances for his hometown club. Charman steered the club to 16th place but a poor run of results the following season led to him being replaced by two more former players, Anthony Storey and Cliff Cant, in January 2015. Despite some impressive initial results, the pair were unable to save the club from relegation so former East Preston manager Dominic di Paola was appointed towards the end of the campaign with a view to rebuilding a side capable of competing in the Sussex County League for the first time since 1951.\r\n\r\nAfter a season-long battle with Eastbourne Town, Horsham took the title by eleven points to secure a record-equalling eighth County League title, thus securing an immediate return to the Isthmian League. During that 2015\/16 campaign, the club recorded a club record ninety-seven points whilst conceding the fewest goals in their history (twenty-two). After a slow start to the 2016\/17 campaign, in which just three of the first thirteen matches were won, the Hornets recovered to finish in a not unsatisfactory sixteenth place in Division One South. Off the pitch the club finally got the news it longed for when, on March 21st 2017, a revised ground application was submitted and overwhelmingly approved by HDC, meaning work could finally begin on constructing a new community stadium off the Worthing Road.\r\n\r\nWith the arrangement at YMCA having come to an end, Horsham moved into the Sussex FA Headquarters at Lancing's Culver Road in the summer of 2017 but a crippling injury list put paid to any pre-season expectations of improving the club's position, with the low point of the season coming in an 8-0 reverse at Cray Wanderers in what is the club's heaviest ever FA Trophy defeat. Yet that result proved the catalyst for the side to kick on and only six of the next nineteen matches ended in defeat, a run that lifted Horsham to eleventh in the table, only to fall away again in the closing months of the season before ending in fifteenth spot, one better than the previous year.\r\n\r\nHopes that the club might start the 2018–19 campaign in the new ground went unfulfilled but the disappointment did not seem to affect the players who turned Culver Road into something of a fortress, losing just four matches in all competitions - two of them to higher-league opponents Bath City and Eastbourne Borough. Overdue runs to the latter stages of the qualifying rounds in both the FA Cup and FA Trophy bred confidence that was transferred into their league form and, from early December, the Hornets never dropped below fourth place, finally finishing as runners-up to Cray Wanderers. With automatic promotion the right of only the champions, Horsham faced a play-off semi-final clash with Haywards Heath Town - the only side to have recorded a league double over them during the campaign - and duly won 3-0 to set up a home final with Ashford United. After a tense tie, played in front of over eight hundred spectators, Horsham won through 2-1 after extra-time to return to the Premier Division after an absence of seven years.\r\n\r\nThe death of President Frank King in May 2019 meant that he tragically missed seeing his beloved Hornets finally take ownership of its new ground, just a few weeks after his death. His name, however, will live on through the decision to dedicate the club's new boardroom in his memory.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Lewes Football Club is a football club based in Lewes, East Sussex, England. They are currently members of the Isthmian League Premier Division and play at the Dripping Pan.\r\n\r\nThe club was established in a meeting at the Royal Oak pub on 23 September 1885. In 1896 they were founder members of the East Sussex League. The club finished bottom of the league in 1898–99 and again the following season. The league was expanded to two divisions in 1899, with Lewes placed in the Senior Division, going on to finish last for a third consecutive season. After finishing bottom of the Senior Division again in 1900–01 without winning a match, the club left the league. They later joined the Mid-Sussex League, entering its Senior Division in 1905. The club were Senior Division runners-up in 1907–08 and again in 1909–10 before winning the league in 1910–11.\r\n\r\nLewes then left the Mid-Sussex League for a reformed East Sussex League, and were runners-up in 1912–13. Although they finished bottom of the East Sussex League the following season, the club also played in the Mid-Sussex League and won the league title. After World War I they spent the 1919–20 season in the Brighton, Hove & District League. In 1920 they were founder members of the Sussex County League. The club were runners-up in 1924–25 and again in 1933–34 and 1958–59, also winning the League Cup in 1938–39.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing as runners-up in 1963–64, Lewes won the Sussex County League title the following season and moved up to Division Two of the Athenian League. They were Division Two champions in 1967–68, earning promotion to Division One. After a third-place finish in their first season in Division One, the club won the division the following season (on goal average) and were promoted to the Premier Division. In 1977 they transferred to Division Two of the Isthmian League, in which they finished as runners-up in 1979–80 to earn promotion to Division One.\r\n\r\nLewes remained in Division One of the Isthmian League until being relegated to Division Two at the end of the 1990–91 season. Although they were promoted back to Division One the following season after finishing as runners-up in Division Two, they were relegated again in 1992–93 and again in 1993–94, dropping into Division Three. The club were Division Three runners-up in 2000–01 and were promoted to Division Two. The following season saw the club reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time; drawn at home to Stoke City, the match was moved to the Britannia Stadium with Stoke winning 2–0. The club finished the season by winning the Division Two title to secure promotion to Division One South;\r\n\r\nAfter winning the Division One South title in 2003–04, Lewes entered a series of play-offs for promotion to the newly formed Conference South; they defeated Yeading 1–0, Basingstoke Town 4–1 and Kingstonian 1–0 to earn a place in the new sixth tier division. Although the club finished fourth in the Conference South in its inaugural season, they were prevented from taking part in the promotion play-offs as the Dripping Pan did not meet the standards required for the Conference National. Another fourth-place finish in 2005–06 saw the club again denied the opportunity to participate in the play-offs.\r\n\r\nIn 2006–07 Lewes reached the first round of the FA Cup again, losing 4–1 at home to Darlington. The following season saw another first round appearance, ending in a 3–0 defeat at Mansfield Town. After winning the Conference South title at the end of the season, the club were promoted to the Conference National, having carried out works on the Dripping Pan. However, after winning the title, manager Steve King and all-but-one of the first team squad left the club. The following season saw them finish bottom of the Conference National, resulting in relegation back to the Conference South.\r\n\r\nIn 2010–11 Lewes were relegated to the Premier Division of the Isthmian League, where they played until being relegated to Division One South at the end of the 2015–16 season. They were Division One South runners-up in 2017–18, earning promotion back to the Premier Division. In the same year they launched Equality FC, with the aim of paying their men's and women's teams equal wages.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Wingate & Finchley Football Club is an English football club based in Finchley in the London Borough of Barnet. The club are currently members of the Isthmian League Premier Division and play at The Maurice Rebak Stadium in North London.\r\n\r\nThe club was established in 1991 by a merger of Wingate and Finchley. Although Finchley were the higher placed of the two clubs, the new club took Wingate's place in the Premier Division of the South Midlands League and played at Finchley's Summers Lane ground, which was renamed after Harry Abrahams, a long time Wingate supporter. In 1994–95 they finished second in the league and joined Division Three of the Isthmian League.\r\n\r\nAfter a second-place finish in 1998–99 they were promoted to Division Two, but were relegated back to Division Three at the end of the following season. After league reorganisation they were placed in Division One North for the 2002–03 season, but in 2004 were transferred to the Eastern Division of the Southern League. The club later returned to Division One North of the Isthmian League. In 2009–10 they finished third, qualifying for the promotion play-offs, in which they lost 3–2 to Enfield Town. The following season the club won the Isthmian League Cup and the London Senior Cup, and finished third again. After beating Harlow Town in the play-off semi-finals, they defeated Brentwood Town 3–2 after extra time in the final, earning promotion to the Premier Division - and securing an historic Treble.\r\n\r\nThe club finished mid-table in its first season in the Premier Division, before surviving a relegation scare in 2012–13 with one match to spare. In 2013–14, the club were relegated on goal difference behind East Thurrock United despite a final day 5-0 victory. However the drama did not end there, as the resignation of Worksop Town from the Northern Premier League gave Wingate & Finchley a much welcomed reprieve from relegation. The club finished the 2015–16 season in 13th position on 60 points. On 8 October 2018, the club pulled a coup by employing Nicky Shorey and Glen Little as managers. This was short lived as Nicky left on 29 October 2018 .",
