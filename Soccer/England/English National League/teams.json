            "strDescriptionEN": "Aldershot Town Football Club is an English association football club based in Aldershot, Hampshire. The club participates in the Conference Premier, the fifth tier of English football. The club was founded in the spring of 1992 after the closure of debt-ridden Fourth Division club Aldershot F.C..\r\n\r\nAldershot Town play at the Recreation Ground in Aldershot. They competed in Football League Two from 2008 to 2013 but were relegated from the Football League at the end of the 2012–13 season. Aldershot Town entered administration on 2 May 2013.\r\n\r\nIn March 1992, the town of Aldershot was without a football club after Aldershot F.C. became the first Football League team to fold during the football season since Accrington Stanley in 1962. Aldershot Town was born later the same year, and began life competing in the Isthmian League Division Three. Despite Aldershot Town playing five divisions lower than the Football League, the attendance for their first competitive fixture was higher than the old team's last home tie. Ten successive victories were recorded under the guidance of former player Steve Wignall and Aldershot won the championship by an 18-point margin.\r\n\r\nA further promotion and an FA Vase quarter-final placing was achieved in the 1993–94 season. When Steve Wignall departed to take charge of Colchester United mid-way through the 1994–95 season, former Nottingham Forest winger Steve Wigley took over. The club finished the 1994–95 season with a run of six successive victories, but missed out on promotion by goal difference. After narrowly missing out during the next two seasons Wigley left in July 1997 to become Youth Development Officer at Nottingham Forest. He was replaced by George Borg. Attendances continued to rise during this period and the final fixture of the 1997–98 Isthmian League First Division championship-winning season, at home to Berkhamsted Town, attracted 4,289 people to the Recreation Ground – a league record. The success under Borg continued with an Isthmian League Cup, two Hampshire Senior Cups and a runners-up spot in the Isthmian League Premier Division.\r\n\r\nThe club's reserves were reinstated in 2000–01 and entered the Suburban League. The FA Cup in 2000–01 saw Aldershot take on league opposition at The Recreation Ground for the first time since reforming, when Brighton & Hove Albion visited for a 1st Round tie in November and a record attendance of 7,500 saw the league team win. In the following season's FA Cup the Shots held Bristol Rovers to a home draw in the First Round, but again missed out on the Second Round after losing the replay in Bristol.\r\n\r\nGeorge Borg resigned as manager in November 2001 after pressure from supporters and was replaced by Terry Brown. He won his first game in charge beating Newport IOW 1–0 in the Hampshire Senior Cup Semi-final Second Leg, taking The Shots on to win the final against Havant & Waterlooville. In Brown's first full season in charge he overhauled the squad, and by mid-November the Shots were top of the table, a position they did not relinquish for the remainder of the season, winning promotion to the Football Conference. The club also retained the Hampshire Senior Cup with a 2–1 win over Bashley.",

They became founder members of the Gloucestershire County League in 1968, before they were moved up to the Premier Division of the Hellenic League seven years later.\r\n\r\nForest Green won the Hellenic League in the 1981–82 season and lifted the FA Vase after beating Rainworth Miners Welfare in the final at Wembley. They spent the next 13 years in the Midland Division of the Southern League, and briefly competed under the name Stroud F.C. Reverting to the name Forest Green Rovers, the club won successive Southern League Southern Division and Premier Division titles in 1996–97 and 1997–98, winning promotion into the Conference. Reaching the 1999 FA Trophy Final, which they lost, they became the first club to reach the finals of both the FA Vase and FA Trophy. They also reached the 2001 FA Trophy Final, which again they lost. Twice reprieved from relegation from the Conference National due to the demotion of other clubs, the club was transformed following investment from green energy industrialist Dale Vince in 2010.\r\n\r\nUnder Dale Vince's chairmanship Forest Green became the world's first vegan football club in 2015, and the New Lawn was installed with numerous eco-friendly innovations. Investment in the playing squad saw the club compete for promotion into the English Football League, which they achieved with victory in the 2017 National League play-offs, having been beaten in the semi-finals in 2015 and in the 2016 final.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Gateshead Football Club is a professional association football club based in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England. The club participates in the National League, the fifth tier of English football. Their most recent notable events include a visit to Wembley, in the play-off final in 2013\/14, and reaching the FA Cup 3rd round in 2014\/2015. The club is very popular among Newcastle United fans and Sunderland fans alike, but also have their own specific fan base famously calling themselves the 'Heed Army'.\r\n\r\nAlthough the club was formed in 1977, it can trace its roots back to 1889. Then, South Shields Adeleide, located eight miles (14 km) from Gateshead, were formed. They originally played in the Northern Alliance before joining the North Eastern Leagues and changing name to just South Shields. They joined the extended Football League Second Division in 1919–20. The mid-to-late 1920s saw the club struggling financially before in 1928 the club finished bottom and were relegated to the Third Division (North). After two unsuccessful seasons in the lower division, the struggling club took the step of not just leaving the Horsley Hill ground but of moving the club to another town in search of more support. Newcastle upon Tyne, was mentioned as a possible destination, but Gateshead was eventually chosen, mainly due to the enthusiastic support of the Gateshead Council.\r\n\r\nThe 'new' club, Gateshead A.F.C., stayed in the Football League until 1960 when they failed to win re-election after finishing in the bottom three of Division Four. They played in various regional leagues before becoming founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968, staying for just two seasons before finishing bottom and again failing to win re-election. They joined the Midland League in 1971 but in August 1973 the club ran into financial problems and were liquidated.\r\n\r\nIn 1974, history repeated itself. A second South Shields FC, formed in 1936, after the previous incarnation had made the afore-mentioned move, also made the move to Gateshead, becoming Gateshead United. United however were not around for too long, being wound up in 1977.\r\n\r\nIn 1977, a new club was formed – Gateshead F.C.. The club were immediately accepted into the Northern Premier League. By this time, their home ground, the Gateshead Youth Stadium, had been upgraded and renamed as Gateshead International Stadium with facilities good enough for a higher grade of football.\r\n\r\nAfter six years Gateshead won promotion from the Northern Premier League to the Alliance Premier League in 1983, with a record tally of points and goals scored. With a relatively lucrative sponsorship, Gateshead spent several seasons in the Football Conference. However, the sponsorship money dried up, and the club started to decline, spending the 2003–04 season in the Northern Premier League First Division. A 6th-place finish was enough to gain promotion to the Premier Division due to the restructuring of the National League System.\r\n\r\nA new board was appointed under the Chairmanship of Graham Wood, which saw Gateshead regain its momentum with the appointment of Ian Bogie as manager. On 3 May 2008, Gateshead beat Buxton 2–0 in the Northern Premier League Premier Division Play-Off Final and were, therefore, promoted to the recently formed Conference North.\r\n\r\nGateshead F.C. absorbed local club Low Fell Juniors to form Gateshead Juniors from the start of the 2008\/09 season, expanding the number of teams under the club banner.\r\n\r\nGateshead finished the 2008–09 season in the Conference North in second (2nd) place. They qualified for the play-offs along with Alfreton Town, Telford United and their semi-final opponents Southport. Gateshead beat Southport 2–1 on aggregate and won the Play-Off Final 1–0 against Telford, earning promotion back to the Conference Premier where they remain.\r\n\r\nGateshead announced on 13 October 2009 that they would be moving to a full-time employed playing squad for the beginning of the 2010–2011 season.\r\n\r\nOn 10 December 2012, manager Ian Bogie and assistant Terry Mitchell were relieved of their duties at the club. Reserve team manager Anth Smith named caretaker manager. Three days later, Smith was named permanent manager and given a contract until the end of the 2012–13 season. On 18 August 2013, David Rush, Smith's assistant, was named as caretaker manager after his resignation, before former York City manager Gary Mills was appointed on 3 September 2013. Mills took Gateshead to third place in the Conference at the end of his first season as manager, qualifying the team for the end-of-season promotion play-offs. An aggregate win over Grimsby Town took Gateshead to their first appearance at Wembley Stadium. However, on 18 May 2014, they lost 2–1 to Cambridge United, who were promoted back into the Football League after a nine-season absence. Gateshead are currently focusing on getting into the Football League.",

The club participates in the National League, the fifth tier of English football. They replaced Halifax Town A.F.C., which went into administration in the 2007–08 season.\r\n\r\nHuge tax debts buried Halifax Town A.F.C. after almost 100 years as a football club. New figures put to a reconvened creditors meeting in May 2008 showed the cash-strapped Shaymen owed over £800,000 to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. The Revenue refused any deal and that effectively finished the club – already over £2 million in the red. Administrators had been trying to broker a rescue package but speaking after five hours of talks that left liquidation near inevitable, administrator Rob Sadler said: \"Halifax Town will probably perish.\" It was originally thought the club owed the taxman around £500,000, which might have left scope for a deal. But the news that it owed £814,000 meant that even if all the other creditors had accepted the 2.5p-in-the-pound offer originally on the table it would not have been enough.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Football Association, discussing the makeup of the football pyramid for the 2008–09 season, FC Halifax Town were not placed in either the Conference Premier, the Conference North or the Northern Premier League Premier Division. Halifax appealed against the decision to remove them from the Football Conference. Though the appeal was rejected on 11 June, the hope was that Halifax could play in the NPL Premier Division. This did not materialise, and eventually Halifax Town were accepted to play in the Northern Premier League Division One North in the new season under the new name F.C. Halifax Town.",

Southend are known as \"The Shrimpers\", a reference to the area's maritime industry included as one of the quarters on the club badge. The club is owned by property developer Ron Martin.\r\n\r\nFounded on 19 May 1906 in the Blue Boar pub, Southend won the Southern League Second Division in both of their two initial seasons and were admitted into the Football League in 1920. They spent the next 44 years in the third tier of English football, before dropping into the Fourth Division in 1966. They spent the next 24 years moving between the third and fourth tiers, winning promotions in 1971–72, 1977–78, 1980–81 (as champions), 1986–87 and 1989–90. They were promoted into the Second Division for the first time at the end of the 1990–91 season. After six seasons in the second tier they suffered a double relegation in 1997 and 1998. Under the stewardship of Steve Tilson, Southend again secured a double promotion in 2004–05 and 2005–06 to win a place in the Championship as League One champions. However this time they only lasted one season in the second tier and were relegated back to League Two in 2010. They secured promotion as play-off winners in 2015, but suffered two successive relegations in 2020 and 2021, amidst financial problems. After 101 years in the Football League, the club were relegated to the National League in the 2020–21 season.\r\n\r\nThe club is based at Roots Hall Stadium in Prittlewell, with plans to move to a new stadium at Fossetts Farm.

            "strDescriptionEN": "Sutton United Football Club is a professional football club in Sutton, South London, England, who play in the National League, the fifth tier of English football. They will compete in the EFL League Two for the 2021–22 season, having been crowned National League champions in 2020–21. They play home games at Gander Green Lane, close to West Sutton Station. The club is an FA Charter Standard Community Club affiliated to the Surrey County Football Association.\r\n\r\nSutton started out playing in junior, local leagues, but progressed into the Athenian League in 1921; the Isthmian League in 1964; and the Conference in 1986. The team fell back into the Isthmian League in 1991. Sutton won the Athenian League three times (1927–28, 1945–46 and 1957–58) and the Isthmian League five times (1966–67, 1984–85, 1985–86, 1998–99 and 2010–11). They appeared in the Conference for one more season in 1999–2000, and were founding members of the Conference South (now known as National League South) in 2004. Sutton won the National League South in 2015–16 and achieved their very first promotion to the Football League after winning the National League title in the 2020–21 season.\r\n\r\nThe team has had several cup successes, including playing at Wembley in the FA Amateur Cup final twice and in the FA Trophy final in 1981. Sutton won the Anglo-Italian Cup in 1979, but the club is most famous for its FA Cup \"giant killing\" exploits, most notably in the 1988–89 season, when they defeated Coventry City 2–1 in the Third Round. The Coventry team was composed mostly of star international players and had won the competition in 1987. In the 2016–17 season, Sutton reached the Fifth Round of the FA Cup for the first time in their history, beating three Football League teams (Cheltenham Town, AFC Wimbledon and Leeds United) before losing 2–0 at home to Arsenal.",

The club participates in the Southern League Premier Division Central under the management of Andrew Danylyszyn and Gary Smith.\r\n\r\nThe club was formed in 1933 after the previous Tamworth club, Tamworth Castle, ceased to exist. After playing in the Birmingham Combination and West Midlands (Regional) League, the team reached the Southern League in 1972, but subsequently fell on hard times and returned to lower level football. In 1989 Tamworth returned to the Southern League and a year later won the FA Vase. Tamworth reached the final of the FA Trophy in 2003 and in the same season won promotion to the Football Conference, going on to spend four seasons at the highest level of non-League football before being relegated to the Conference North. In 2009 the club gained promotion back to the Conference Premier, and spent five seasons at that level before being relegated. Further relegation in 2018 took the club back to the Southern League.\r\n\r\nThe team originally played at The Jolly Sailor Ground but after a year moved into The Lamb Ground, named after a pub which formerly stood nearby. The stadium currently has a capacity of just under 5,000 and a 3G artificial pitch which was laid in 2016. Local rivals include Burton Albion and Nuneaton Town, and to a lesser degree Atherstone Town, Bedworth United and Bolehall Swifts.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Yeovil Town Football Club is a professional association football club based in the town of Yeovil, Somerset, England. The team compete in National League, the fifth tier of the English football league system.\r\n The club have previously won the League Two championship in 2004–05, and promotion to the Championship through the play-offs in 2013. Founded in 1895, Yeovil took 108 years to enter the Football League when they were promoted from the Football Conference as champions in 2003.\r\n\r\nYeovil have been one of the most successful non-league teams in the FA Cup – having defeated major Football League teams, most famously Sunderland in the 4th Round in 1949, going on to play in front of more than 81,000 against Manchester United at Maine Road, temporarily shared with local rival Manchester City following the bombing of Old Trafford in the Second World War. Since entering the Football League FA Cup results have deteriorated having only reached the 3rd Round twice including, in 2004, against Liverpool for which the club released a record prior to the tie sold only in shops in the town, \"Yeovil True\" reached #36 in the UK Singles Chart. The only other successful performance since then was in 2005 when they reached the 4th Round, drawn away against then Premier League side Charlton Athletic where they narrowly lost 3–2.\r\n\r\nTheir home ground is Huish Park, built in 1990 on the site of an old army camp and named after their former home, Huish, itself known for its pitch, which had an 8 feet (2.4 m) sideline to sideline slope. The club's nickname The Glovers is a reference to the history of glove-making in the town of Yeovil, which became a centre of the industry during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "York City Football Club is a professional association football club based in the city of York, North Yorkshire, England. The team compete in the National League, the fifth level of the English football league system, as of the 2023–24 season.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1922, the club played seven seasons in non-League football before joining the Football League. York played in the Third Division North and Fourth Division until 1959, when they were promoted for the first time. York achieved their best run in the FA Cup in 1954–55, when they met Newcastle United in the semi-final. They fluctuated between the Third and Fourth Divisions, before spending two seasons in the Second Division in the 1970s. York first played at Wembley Stadium in 1993, when they won the Third Division play-off final. At the end of 2003–04, they lost their Football League status after being relegated from the Third Division. The 2011–12 FA Trophy was the first national knockout competition won by York, and they returned to the Football League that season before being relegated back into non-League football in 2016.\r\n\r\nYork are nicknamed the Minstermen, after York Minster, and the team traditionally play in red kits. They played at Fulfordgate from 1922 to 1932, when they moved to Bootham Crescent, their home for 88 years. This ground had been subject to numerous improvements over the years, but the club lost ownership of it when it was transferred to a holding company in 1999. York bought it back five years later, but the terms of the loan used to do so necessitated a move to a new ground. They moved into their current ground, the York Community Stadium, in 2021. York have had rivalries with numerous clubs, but their traditional rivals are Hull City and Scarborough. The club's record appearance holder is Barry Jackson, who made 539 appearances, while their leading scorer is Norman Wilkinson, with 143 goals.",
