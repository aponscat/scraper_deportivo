            "strDescriptionEN": "Hapoel Afula is an Israeli football club based in Afula. The club is currently in Liga Leumit and plays at the Afula Illit Stadium. Their main rivals are Hapoel Asi Gilboa.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1924 in Beit Jann, near Yavne'el, by Russian Jews affiliated with Hashomer Hatzair movement. Due to unemployment in Beit Gan, the club relocated to Afula. During its early days, Hapoel Afula played mostly in friendlies against the likes of Hapoel Haifa and in regional leagues, comprising clubs from the Northern and Haifa regions.\r\n\r\nAfter the Israeli Declaration of Independence, the club was re-established in 1951. At the summer of 1954, the club merged with neighboring football club, Hapoel Balfouria, which played at the time at the top flight of Israeli football, and played home matches in Afula.\r\n\r\nSince the 1957–58 season, while playing in Liga Alef, the second tier of Israeli football at the time, the club was officially known under its current name, although they were mentioned by the press in both Hapoel Afula and Hapoel Balfouria names. the club continued to play as Hapoel Afula, and the name of Balfouria was dropped. In the 1958–59 season the club finished bottom in Liga Alef, and went to play in the relegation play-offs. In spite the club finished the relegation play-offs in a perfect record against Hapoel Be'er Sheva, Hapoel Netanya and Maccabi Sha'arayim, they were eventually disqualified and demoted to Liga Bet for fielding ineligible player.\r\n\r\nThe club played for 17 successive seasons in Liga Bet, until they were relegated to Liga Gimel at the end of the 1976–77 season. The club made an immediate return to Liga Bet, where they played up until the 1983–84 season, in which the club folded during the season.\r\n\r\nThe club reformed in 2001, and reached Liga Bet in the 2002–03 season, where they finished runners-up in the North B division. In the following season, the club won that division and were promoted to Liga Alef. After 9 seasons in Liga Alef, the club finally managed to win promotion to Liga Leumit, when they won the 2012–13 season in Liga Alef North, by a margin of ten points, and made a return to the second tier of Israeli football after 54 years.\r\n\r\nIn The 2013–14 season, the club reached the top play-off in Liga Leumit, and finished in the 6th place, an achievement which was bettered in the following season, after the club finished in the 4th place.\r\n\r\nIn the 2014–15 Israel State Cup, the club eliminated top flight club, Maccabi Petah Tikva, in the Quarter-finals by away goals (0–0, 2–2), and reached the Semi-finals for the first time in their history. However, in the Semi-finals, Hapoel Afula were hammered 0–7 by Hapoel Be'er Sheva in Teddy Stadium, Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nOn 6 December 2017, the club won its first major trophy, after beating Hapoel Ramat Gan in the Toto Cup Leumit final.",

However, they were quickly promoted to Liga Gimel, and prior to the 1963–64 season, they were promoted to Liga Bet by the Israeli Football Association, after winning a special draw, in order to make an even number of clubs in Liga Bet North B division.\r\n\r\nIn the following season, the club was transferred to Liga Bet South A division, and made history by winning the division, and promotion to Liga Alef, the second tier of Israeli football at the time. the club finished their first season in Liga Alef South in the 11th place. however, in the following season, which was actually the \"double season\" of 1966–68, the club finished bottom with 10 wins out of 60 matches, and relegated back to Liga Bet.\r\n\r\nBy the late 1980s, the club returned to Liga Alef (now as third tier), and in 1995 were promoted to Liga Artzit, and made a return to the second tier of Israeli football after 27 years. however, their spell in Liga Artzit lasted one season, as they finished bottom at the 1995–96 season with 4 wins out of 30 matches, and relegated back to Liga Alef.\r\n\r\nIn the 2006–07 season, the club finished runners-up in Liga Alef South behind champions, Hapoel Maxim Lod. however, as the latter folded, Kfar Shalem was promoted instead to Liga Artzit (now as third tier). in the following season in Liga Artzit, the club finished bottom once more, with 4 wins out of 33 matches, and relegated back to Liga Alef (now as third tier, following the closure of Liga Artzit in 2009), where they played until their promotion to the second division in 2020.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Hapoel Nof HaGalil Football Club (Hebrew: מועדון כדורגל הפועל נוף הגליל‎, Moadon Kaduregel Hapoel Nof HaGalil) is an Israeli football club based in the city of Nof HaGalil, which was known by the name \"Nazareth Illit\" until 2019.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1962 as Hapoel Kiryat Nazareth and competed in Liga Gimel for several seasons, before promoting to Liga Bet at the end of the 1971–72 season. The club changed its name in 1973 after Kiryat Nazareth gained city status and was renamed Nazareth Illit.\r\n\r\nThe club won 1975–76 Liga Bet, but, due to the league system restructuring, the club remained in the league system's third tier, which became Liga Alef. In 1978–79 the club won Liga Alef North division and was promoted to Liga Artzit, then the second tier. In 1983–84 they finished second from bottom, and were relegated to Liga Alef. Two seasons later the club finished second from bottom in Liga Alef and dropped to Liga Bet.\r\n\r\nIn 1998–99 the club finished as runners-up in Liga Alef North, and was promoted back to Liga Artzit, which was now the third tier following the formation of the Israeli Premier League in 1999. After narrowly avoiding relegation in 2000–01 when they finished one place above the relegation zone, the club finished as runners-up the following season, and were promoted back to the second tier. In 2003–04 they finished as runners-up (on goal difference), and were promoted to the top division for the first time in their history.\r\n\r\nIn their first season in the Premier League the club finished fifth. Home matches were initially played at Maccabi Ahi Nazareth's Ilut Stadium, whilst their home ground had floodlights installed. They returned home in February 2005. However, the following season, 2005–06, they finished second from bottom (on goal difference), and returned to Liga Leumit. In 2007–08 they finished bottom of Liga Leumit, and were relegated to Liga Artzit.\r\n\r\nDespite only finishing seventh in Liga Artzit in 2008–09, F.C. Nazareth Illit were promoted back to Liga Leumit as restructuring meant the top seven clubs were automatically promoted. Since then, Nazareth Illit hasn't been relegated for 3 consecutive seasons, finishing seventh in 2009–10, 11th in 2010–11 and twelfth in 2011–12.\r\n\r\nIn the 2012–13 season the club signed several new players, including Ibrahim Basit, Eran Malchin and Moti Malka; they finished second in the league, but lost 3–1 at home in a crucial match against Hapoel Ra'anana in the play-offs, with Ra'anana eventually promoted to the Israeli Premier League, whilst Nazareth Illit finished third and remained in Liga Leumit. In 2018–19 the club finished the regular season at the top of the table, but a collapse during the playoff phase, with the club collecting just 7 points out of 21, led the club to finish in third place and miss out on promotion.\r\n\r\nOn 4 July 2019, after the name of Nazareth Illit was changed to Nof HaGalil, the club changed its name to Hapoel Nof HaGalil",

They are currently members of Liga Leumit and play their home matches at the Grundman Stadium.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1957 as Hapoel Ramat HaSharon, the club was promoted to Liga Artzit (then the second division) in 1984. In the 1984–85 season they narrowly missed out on promotion to Liga Leumit (then the top division), after losing 1–0 to Hapoel Jerusalem on the final day of the season; had they won, they would have been promoted in Jerusalem's place. The following season they were relegated to Liga Alef, and two seasons later to Liga Bet.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 the club returned to Liga Alef and in summer 1997 merged with Maccabi Nir Ramat HaSharon, a club which was named after Nir Itzhaki, by his brother and the club's chairmen, Meir Itzhaki, after Maccabi was refused funding by the local council. The merged club took the name Hapoel Ironi Nir Ramat HaSharon.\r\n\r\nIn 1999–2000 they finished second in their division. Due to Beitar Tel Aviv and Shimshon Tel Aviv merging, the club was promoted to Liga Artzit (now the third tier) to fill the vacancy. In 2002–03 they narrowly avoided relegation, finishing one place above the relegation zone. The following season they won the league to earn promotion back to the second division. In the same season they also won the Liga Artzit Toto Cup.\r\n\r\nThe club escaped relegation in 2004–05 after Maccabi Ahi Nazareth had two points deducted. The following season they finished third from bottom again, but avoided the drop.\r\n\r\nIn the 2009–10 season the club made one of its biggest achievements in the club's history when the team reached the semi final of the Israel State Cup.\r\n\r\nIn the 2010–11 season the club won the Toto Cup Leumit and got promoted to the Israeli Premier League for the first time in the history of the club after they finished as champions of Liga Leumit. In June 2013, the club changed its name from Ironi Nir Ramat HaSharon to Hapoel Nir Ramat HaSharon and changed it logo.\r\n\r\nIn the 2012–13 season, the club achieved its best placing to date, when they finished sixth in the Israeli Premier League. However, in the following season, the club finished second bottom and relegated to Liga Leumit.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Hapoel Rishon LeZion F.C. (Hebrew: הפועל ראשון לציון‎) is an Israeli football club based in the city of Rishon LeZion, which currently plays in Liga Leumit, Israel's second football division. Home matches are hosted at the Haberfeld Stadium. In 1991, the club changed its name to Hapoel Ironi Rishon LeZion (Hebrew: הפועל עירוני ראשון לציון‎), and in June 2008 the name was switched back to Hapoel Rishon LeZion following a change in ownership.\r\n\r\nHapoel Rishon LeZion was one of the first clubs in the history of league football in Israel. The football section of the Sports club was established in 1929, and played several matches since 1933, including competing at the Palestine Cup in 1937 and 1939. The club was formally established in 1940.\r\n\r\nIts best achievements were runner-up of the Israel State Cup in 1946 and 1996. On both occasions it lost to Maccabi Tel Aviv. Following its cup final in 1996, it played in UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, but was eliminated in the qualifying round by Constructorul Chisinau of Moldova on away goals rule (0:1, 3:2).\r\n\r\nThe club played at the top division in Mandatory Palestine for the first time at the 1941–42 season and after the Israeli Declaration of Independence, became founder members of the Israeli League in 1949. In 1951–52, the club finished second bottom and dropped to the second tier.\r\n\r\nBetween 1952 and 1994 the club played just three seasons in the top division: 1978-79, 1980–81 (where they finished sixth) and 1981–82. In the 1991–92 season, while playing in Liga Alef, the third tier, it added the word Ironi to its name, and in the next two seasons, made two successive promotions and returned to the top flight once again after winning Liga Artzit in the 1993–94 season. This time the club managed to stay nine consecutive seasons in the top league until it was relegated to the second tier, (Liga Leumit), at the end of the 2002–03 season, and three seasons later dropped further down to Liga Artzit, the third tier at the time.\r\n\r\nIn 2008–09, after the club changed its name back to Hapoel Rishon LeZion, it was promoted to Liga Leumit, the second tier.\r\n\r\nIn 2010–11, the club was promoted to the Israeli Premier League, the top tier. They were relegated back to Liga Leumit the following season.\r\n\r\nOn 4 December 2012, Hapoel Rishon LeZion won the 2012–13 Toto Cup Leumit.\r\n\r\nIn 2017-18, the club was just one point short of being promoted to the top tier, The Israeli Premier League, finishing third. In the following year, 2018-19, the club finished twelfth, and narrowly avoided relegation.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Before the beginning of the 2008–09 season, some of Maccabi Jaffa's old fans gathered and reestablished the team under the name Maccabi Kabilio Jaffa (the team is being called after its goalkeeper in the 1970s Herzl Kabilio who died from cancer at the age of 35). The club is a fan's club, and gains its money from the donations made by the fans. The team was registered for the 2008–09 season for the bottom league in Israel, Liga Gimel.\r\n\r\nIn that season, Jaffa won the Israeli State Cup for Liga Gimel, and finished in the first place of the Tel Aviv division, with only one loss. Jaffa played the promotion game against Ironi Beit Dagan in Bloomfield Stadium in front of 9,000 fans.\r\n\r\nJaffa played in Liga Bet in the season of 2009–10. in this season Jaffa made history when they became the first club from Liga Bet, since 1963, to reach the Round of 16 of the Israeli State Cup. In the way to this phase, Jaffa won against Hapoel Hadera from Liga Alef and Ironi Kiryat Shmona which won the second division in that season. In the Round of 16 to the Final, Jaffa lost 0–5 to Hapoel Tel Aviv, which eventually went to win both the State Cup and the Premier League in that season.\r\n\r\nDuring the season, Jaffa won the Israeli State Cup for Liga Bet, and finished the season in the first place with no losses. Maccabi Kabilio Jaffa was the only team in Israel, which was undefeated during the entire 2009–10 season.\r\n\r\nJaffa started its third season in Liga Alef, the third league in Israel. In this season, Jaffa broke their winning sequence, when they lost to Maccabi Ironi Netivot in Netivot. The loss came after 65 consecutive games without a loss, the longest period of time in which an Israeli team played without losing.\r\n\r\nJaffa finished the season in fourth place and qualified for the promotion play-offs. After beating Bnei Eilat, Maccabi Kiryat Malakhi and Asi Gilboa in the Liga Alef play-offs, Jaffa faced the 14th placed in 2010–11 Liga Leumit, Hakoah Ramat Gan. Jaffa lost the first leg in their home stadium in Holon by a result of 1–2, and the second leg in Ramat Gan ended in 1–1 draw. Thus, Maccabi Kabilio Jaffa remained in Liga Alef.\r\n\r\nJaffa finished as runners-up for third successive seasons, in 2011–12, 2012–13 and 2013–14. However, they failed to achieve promotion to Liga Leumit, after losing to Beitar Kfar Saba in the first round of the promotion play-offs, in 2012–13 and 2013–14.\r\n\r\nIn the 2014–15 season, Jaffa surprisingly found itself in the battle against relegation and finished in the 14th place. However, they survived in Liga Alef, after beating the Liga Bet South play-offs winner, Hapoel Kiryat Ono, by a result of 2–0, in the Relegation play-offs.\r\n\r\nMaccabi Kabilio Jaffa are currently in Liga Alef South division. The current season, is their sixth consecutive season in this league.",
