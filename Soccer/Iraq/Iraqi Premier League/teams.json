In 1974, the club was merged with another club called Al-Bareed to form a single club called Al-Muwasalat, and it was a strange situation because the Al-Bareed team were based in Baghdad while Al-Mina'a were based in Basra and the two teams met in Baghdad on the day of the match only, so after just one season the club was dissolved and Al-Mina'a returned in their place. In 1978, the team won the national league title for the first time. After a lean period in the post-war years, the team finished second in the league in the 2004–05 season, and therefore qualified for the 2006 AFC Champions League, becoming the first Iraqi club from outside Baghdad to play in this tournament.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, the club was considered to be one of the Iraqi football clubs that had its own style of play, and the team practised only under the supervision and training of coaches who graduated from the club, until the beginning of 2011, when the club started to depend on foreign coaches.",

Some of the dignitaries of the city were contacted for this purpose. The request was submitted to the Ministry of the Interior, which was responsible for the authorisation of sports clubs in Iraq at that time. The name of Al Ghiri Sports Club was proposed for this institution. In 1961, the Ministry of the Interior approved their request to establish the club and thus wrote the birth certificate of the first sports club in the city of Najaf and consisted of the first administrative body of Messrs. Naji Hassan Hasswa as president and Maki Hadi Maala Vice-President and Alwan Elsafer as secretary. At the beginning of the establishment of the club, the Ministry of the Interior allocated an annual grant of 60 dinars divided into two instalments, and the club relied on this grant and monthly subscriptions from its members.",

'Police Sports Club') is an Iraqi sports club based in Rusafa District, East Districts of the Tigris River, Baghdad. It has teams in 18 different sports, more than any other Iraqi club. The oldest and best known section of the club is the football team, which was founded in 1932 under the name Montakhab Al-Shorta and they are the third-oldest existing football club in the country.\r\n\r\nThey are one of Iraq's most successful clubs and they are the only existing Iraqi team to win a major top-tier continental club competition, having lifted the Arab Champions League trophy in 1982 after a 4–2 aggregate win over Al-Nejmeh in the final. They also reached the final of the AFC Champions League in 1971, where they refused to face Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv in protest at the Israeli occupation of Palestine, instead waving the Palestinian flag around the field. They were referred to as champions by the Arab media and were greeted with a heroes' reception upon their return to Baghdad, holding an open top bus parade, with Israel being expelled from the AFC three years later. The club has added two stars above their logo to represent these two achievements.\r\n\r\nThey are the reigning champions of the Iraqi Premier League, having won the title in the 2018–19 season. They also won a joint record three Iraqi Elite Cups, in 2000, 2001 and 2002, being the only team to win that trophy three consecutive times. Al-Shorta hold numerous Premier League records in Iraq, such as the longest unbeaten run, the fewest losses in a season, the fewest goals conceded in a season, the most consecutive wins in a season, the most consecutive games scored in and the most seasons played in the top-flight.",

Zakho SC's biggest rivals are also their neighbours Duhok SC, always producing the most passionate and fierce matches every season, with whom they contest the Duhok Derby.\r\n\r\nFootball in Zakho was played unofficially from the early 1920s with many local amateur games as well as school competitions regularly being held in Zakho or nearby districts. This eventually led to the formation of the first ever football team in Zakho in 1948. This was made up of local workers and young men.",
