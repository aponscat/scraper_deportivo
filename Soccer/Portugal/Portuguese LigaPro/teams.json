            "strDescriptionEN": "Grupo Desportivo de Chaves, commonly known as Chaves is a Portuguese football club from Chaves currently playing in the LigaPro. They were founded in 1949 and currently play at Estádio Municipal de Chaves with a capacity of 12,000, one of the biggest in the division. Their home kit is red-and-blue striped shirt with blue shorts and socks and the away kit is all white. Their current president is Bruno Carvalho and their manager is Ricardo Soares. Chaves have been in the Portuguese First Division 13 times and had their best finish of fifth-place in the 1989–90 season. They went to Europe in the 1987–88 season where they played in the UEFA Cup, beating Romanian side Universitatea Craiova in the first round but lost in the next round to Hungarian team Budapest Honvéd.\r\n\r\nGrupo Desportivo de Chaves was founded on 27 September 1949 and is one of the most experienced teams in the Portuguese Second Division, not just because of its old culture, but also many years in the top-flight Primeira Liga, doing quite well and playing in European tournaments, such as the UEFA Cup. Their best ever finish was in the Primeira Liga when they finished fifth in both 1986–87 and 1989–90. In the 1986–87 season, meanwhile, they had fantastic results, beating Sporting Clube de Portugal 2–1 at home in a memorable night at the Estádio Municipal de Chaves. After those fantastic seasons, they finished sixth, seventh and ninth before getting relegated in the 1992–93 season to the Liga de Honra. They returned for another few seasons but then again suffered relegation to the Liga de Honra until 2007, where they eventually got relegated to the Portuguese Second Division: Série A. In the previous season of 2007–08, they finished in fourth place, just missing out on promotion.\r\n\r\nAfter a series of great results in 2008–09 that granted the team the lead of Série A, Chaves finally achieved promotion to the second-flight Liga de Honra with an aggregate 1–0 win over Penafiel, the winner of the Portuguese Second Division: Série B in a semi-final playoff. In the playoff final, it was between Chaves and Fátima, in which both were guaranteed promotion to the Liga de Honra, with the final set to determine the champions. Fátima won the match 2–1. Chaves spent the following three years in the third division before being crowned Segunda Divisão champions in 2012–13, thus gaining promotion back to the Segunda Liga. After missing out on promotion to the first division during a thrilling final day of the 2014–15 season, Chaves were promoted the following season back to the top-flight Primeira Liga for the first time in 17 years.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Clube Desportivo Feirense, commonly known as CD Feirense or just Feirense, is a Portuguese football club based in Santa Maria da Feira. Founded on 18 March 1918, Feirense play in the Primeira Liga, the top flight of Portuguese football. Their chairman is Rodrigo Nunes Silva Abelha and their manager is Nuno Manta Santos. The club plays its home matches at the Estádio Marcolino de Castro, with a capacity of 5,500 spectators. It currently plays in the LigaPro, Portugal's second-tier division of professional football.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the first initiatives of its founders, Luís Amorim, Artur Bastos, Luís Cadilon and Arthur Lee, was to acquire land to build the first playground in the woods at Picalhos near the railway Valley Vouga. In 1924, they leased land and started embankments and soon the first few games took place against the Lourosa on 4 May 1924 in which the Feirense won 2–1. The first president was Santa Maria da Feiria native Alcides Machado da Silva, who took office on 30 December 1924.\r\n\r\nIn 1926 and ever since, the club has kept the Feirense, created a committee with the aim of acquiring a new site with better conditions for a new field, having managed in the Place of Montinho, closer to the center of the Town of Fair, belonging to Mr. Simon Adriano. Curiously, this time Feirense were fitted with a red and black sweater with vertical stripes. On 2 March 1931, the field of Montinho was opened with a selection match between Porto and Aveiro, and that year the team was equipped with a blue shirt, black shorts and black socks.\r\n\r\nIn the 1931–32 season, Feirense first participated in a tournament, debuting in the championship of the promotion of Aveiro, the lower division of the district, being defeated 2–1 in the first official game in the field of Cortegaça. Since the late 1930s and until 1950, Feirense went through various difficulties and the main note of relief was the creation of the first emblem of C.D. Feirense designed by António da Costa. Feirense continued its participation in the championship district of Aveiro and on 15 January 1955, Marcolino Castro was elected for the first time as president of Feirense (he would go on to later be elected five more times and lead over a total of nine seasons) and the team began to primarily wear blue shirts and white shorts. The next year, for the first time the team participated in the national championship of the 3rd Division, with the first game played in Avintes. In March 1956, the club's youth department was founded, as well as the creation of a team of juniors.\r\n\r\nIn 1958, the first statutes of the club were approved, the flag's colors and design for the new badge were authored by Dr. Humberto de Paiva. In the 1959–60 season, Feirense won the first district championship of Aveiro and at the same time played the 3rd Division, managing to also climb to the 2nd Division. Feirense repeated the title of district champion of Aveiro in the 1965–66 and 1967–68 seasons. In 1960–61, they first participated in the National League division 2.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1960s, Feirense had one of the best periods in its history, achieving victory in the northern part of the 2nd Division, inauguration of the current stadium and Marcolino Castro premiere at the 1st National Division in 1962–63. In 1968–69, Feirense won its first title of the Aveiro district youth in the juvenile level. In 1969, Arthur Eng Brandão, patron of the training school, was elected for the first time chairman of the board, which happened four more times and a total of nine seasons.\r\n\r\nArthur and Marcolino Brandão de Castro were the presidents who had the longest terms leading the club. In 1975–76, the club's youth were in evidence with the presence of the youth team in the final of the National 2nd division held in Tomar. In 1976–77, Feirense won the central area of the 2nd division next season and raced for the 2nd time the national championship in Division 1. In 1982–83, the youth team of juvenile Feirense after winning the same district title, disputed the semi-finals of the National Youth Cup. On 22 September 1987 Feirense for the first time had a field of natural grass turf with the inauguration of the stadium Marcolino Castro. In 1988–89, the Feirense winner was again the center region of the 2nd division next season and race for the 3rd time the national championship in Division 1. In 1990, Fernando Carvalho da Feirense's cycling team won the 52nd back to Portugal in cycling.\r\n\r\nIn 1990–91 the Feirense was matched in the semi-finals of the Cup of Portugal with Porto. After the draw at the end of extra time forced the second game in the Antas stadium which was eventually eliminated. In this year also participated for the 1st time in 2 then created division of honor. In 1996 he was assigned to the Feirense medal for sporting merit by the secretary of state of the sport. After several district titles won by the club's youth, we have since the 1999–00 season on staying at the same time of 3 levels (junior, youth and started) in the national championships, the unique situation in the district in so many consecutive years, continuing to gain Titles on children and schools. Was created in 2000 by Rodrigo Nunes, then responsible for the Juvenile Department, the training school Arthur Brandao.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, he took possession for the first time Rodrigo Nunes, the current President of Feirense and presented his model of the sport of golf, the club anthem written by Ernesto Campos, the monthly magazine Feirense Magazine\", the 1st Gala club, the party Christmas and amended the statutes and emblem. At this time the Feirense revitalized the gym and set the terms of swimming, cycling and handball. In the 2002–03 season rose again to the 2nd Division of honor. In June 2003, Rodrigo Nunes is elected for a 2nd term. This would be unprecedented, as no previous president had been elected two consecutive mandates. In late 2004 the Feirense, presented the 1st phase of the new Sports Complex, and from there all the athletes of the club began to train and play only on lawns natural and synthetic, unique in Portugal even in clubs called major (Benfica, Sporting CP, Porto). In June 2005, Rodrigo Nunes is the third consecutive elected President of the Board for more than a full biennium and it will be at the helm of the Feirense for 6 consecutive years, a situation that has never happened before. In the 2007–08 season, the senior team handball went to the 2nd Division. In the 2011–12 the main soccer team participated in the Portuguese Liga, with Rodrigo Nunes still at the helm.",

Twenty-six years later, the first trophy came, with the conquest of the Taça de Campeão Nacional after defeating Tramagal Sport União (5–3). The club spent the vast majority of its early years in the Campeonato de Portugal.\r\n\r\nIn 1984, Vizela promoted for the first time in its history to the Primeira Liga, but this spell only lasted one season, with the club ranking last. Shortly after, the team was again in the third level, only returning in the 2000s.\r\n\r\nAgain in the \"silver category\" of Portuguese football, Vizela finished third in the 2007–08 season, falling just one point short of a promotion. In the following year, it finished in 10th position, but was relegated due to the Apito Dourado scandal; for several years, the club acted as S.C. Braga's farm team.",
