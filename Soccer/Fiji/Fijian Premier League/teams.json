Labasa did not join the National Association when it was formed, in 1938, due to the distance of Labasa from the main island of Viti Levu, where all, except one, club was based.\r\n\r\nIn 1942, under the Presidency of Harold B. Gibson, a former member of the Legislative Council, Labasa Soccer Association joined the national football body, then known as the Fiji Indian Football Association.\r\n\r\nLabasa remained at the periphery of football in Fiji, struggling to compete with teams from Viti Levu, until 1969, when it hosted the Inter-District Championship (IDC) for the first time. The team was runner-up in the IDC of 1972, 1973 and 1978. Labasa F.C. won the IDC for the first time in 1992 and again two years later in 1994.\r\n\r\nIn October 2011, the team won its third IDC tournament defeating Ba F.C. 1–0 at the TFL National Stadium in Suva.
