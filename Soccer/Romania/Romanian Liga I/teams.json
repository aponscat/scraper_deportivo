            "strDescriptionEN": "Fotbal Club CFR 1907 Cluj is a Romanian professional football club based in the city of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj County. It was founded in 1907 and the current name \"CFR\" is the acronym for Căile Ferate Române (\"Romanian Railways\").\r\n\r\nBefore receiving significant financial support from previous owner Árpád Pászkány in 2002, the club had spent most of its existence in the lower divisions. Since returning to the top flight in 2004, CFR Cluj has relied increasingly on foreign players for its success. In the 2005–06 season, they participated in their first European competition, the Intertoto Cup, finishing as runners-up. In the 2007–08 campaign, they were champions of Liga I for the first time in their history, taking the national title away from capital-based teams after seventeen years and consequently qualifying for the UEFA Champions League group stage in the process. Only six years earlier, CFR was playing in the third tier of the Romanian football league system. Between 2018 and 2019, \"the White and Burgundies\" won back-to-back championships for the first time. CFR has won a total of twelve domestic trophies, all in the 21st century—five Liga I, four Cupa României, and three Supercupa României.\r\n\r\nCFR has a fierce rivalry with neighbouring Universitatea Cluj, with matches between the two being known as the Derbiul Clujului.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Fotbal Club FCSB (formerly named and still sometimes referred to as FC Steaua București, is a Romanian professional football club based in Bucharest. It has spent its entire history in the Liga I, the top flight of the Romanian football league system.\r\n\r\nThe original Steaua București football team was founded in 1947 and belonged to the Ministry of National Defence, through the namesake CSA Steaua București sports club. In 1998, the football department and its facilities were separated from the latter and taken over by a group of shareholders in a post-Ceaușescu privatisation scheme, leading to one of the shareholders acquiring full ownership five years later. However, CSA Steaua București has been in conflict with the football club since 2011, claiming that it was a new and separate entity; this resulted in multiple court cases and the forced change of the name from FC Steaua București to FC FCSB in early 2017.\r\n\r\nDomestically, when taken together with the disputed pre-2003 honours, the club has won the Liga I 27 times, Cupa României 24 times, Cupa Ligii two times, and Supercupa României six times—all competition records. Internationally, they have won the European Cup and European Super Cup, both in 1986. They reached the European Cup final once again in 1989, when they were defeated by AC Milan. Throughout their history, the Roș-albaștrii also played the final of the Intercontinental Cup, the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup, and the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup.\r\n\r\nFCSB's home ground is Arena Națională, having moved here from the Ministry of National Defence-owned Stadionul Ghencea. Initially, the club played in the colours of the Romanian tricolour, but the team became associated with the red and blue scheme after yellow soon lost its importance. Recently, some kits have begun reintegrating the latter colour.\r\n\r\nThe club has a long-standing rivalry with neighbouring Dinamo București, with matches between the two being commonly referred to as the \"Eternal derby\" or the \"Romanian derby\". Another notable rivalry is the one against Rapid București, while several milder ones are disputed against teams outside the capital, including a recent one against CFR Cluj that commenced because of the title competitions these teams fought in 21st century.",

During that period, it had won four national titles and five national cups. For the next two decades, its tradition was taken further by FC U Craiova, which was reorganised several times, disaffiliated and retroactively deemed as an unofficial successor. In 2013, the sports club refounded the football department, which asserts to be the continuation of the original Universitatea Craiova—this has since been backed up by some court orders and the Liga Profesionistă de Fotbal, however the record is still subject of dispute with the also reestablished FC U entity and uncertainty persists. In 2018, \"the White-Blues\" won the Cupa României, representing their first trophy following the refoundation.\r\n\r\nOn the European stage, Universitatea Craiova's best performances are reaching the semi-finals of the 1982–83 UEFA Cup and the quarter-finals of the 1981–82 European Cup. They were the first Romanian team to reach the semi-finals of a UEFA tournament and remain the only one to have knocked out at least one club from each of five strongest countries in European football: England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.\r\n\r\n\"The Students\" play their home matches at the Stadionul Ion Oblemenco, which has a capacity of 30,929. Craiova holds several rivalries, the most notable being the one with Dinamo București.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Fotbal Club UTA Arad (commonly known as UTA Arad, or simply as UTA, is a Romanian professional football club based in the city of Arad, Arad County, currently playing in Liga II. UTA stands for Uzina Textilă Arad.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1945 as IT Arad, they have won the national title six times and the national cup twice. Domestically, along with Chinezul Timișoara, UTA can be considered one of the most successful Romanian clubs of the 20th century, with only three teams winning more championships during that period—Steaua, Dinamo and Venus, all from Bucharest. After a decline which started in 1979 with a relegation to the second league, in 2014 the team was dissolved. With the support of fans, a new team started its way back from Liga IV, the fourth level of Romanian league system, and is credited as the official successor of the defunct club.\r\n\r\n\"The Old Lady\" plays in red and white kits at the Motorul Stadium, as their traditional home ground, Francisc von Neuman, is currently under reconstruction.",
