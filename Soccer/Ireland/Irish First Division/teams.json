Dundalk compete in the League of Ireland Premier Division, the top tier of Irish football, and are the League Champions and League of Ireland Cup holders, having won both in 2019. Founded in 1903 as the works-team of the Great Northern Railway company, they played in junior competition until they joined the Leinster Senior League in 1922. After four seasons in that division, they were elected to the Free State League, which later became the League of Ireland, in 1926.\r\n\r\nIn 1932–33 they became the first club from outside Dublin to win the league title, and have won at least one league title or FAI Cup in every decade since. They are now the second most successful club in the League's history, and the most successful in the Premier Division era. In 1936 they moved from their original home at the Athletic Grounds in the town centre to their present ground, Oriel Park. The team has played in white shirts since 1928, and adopted the present colours of white shirts with black shorts in 1940. The club's crest was also adopted in 1928 and is based on the town's old Corporation Arms.\r\n\r\nDundalk made their European debut as League Champions in the 1963–64 European Cup, and became the first Irish side to win an away match in Europe the same season. In the 1979–80 European Cup they reached the last 16, which was their best European performance until 2016. That season they reached the group stage of the 2016–17 Europa League, and became the first team from Ireland to both win points and win a match at that level of European competition. They have qualified for Europe a total of 24 times and are now the highest ranked Irish side as measured by UEFA club coefficients.",

The club was founded in 2020 in the place of Limerick F.C. following their financial collapse, and began playing in the League of Ireland in 2021. They play their home matches at Markets Field, the same ground as their predecessors.\r\n\r\nFollowing the liquidation of Limerick F.C., the idea of a new team in Limerick arose. At first, it was to be called Limerick United but was forced to be changed due to threat of legal action from Limerick FC, because they had previously had that name. The idea of Treaty United came about because Limerick is also known as the Treaty County. Treaty United was confirmed as the name, and the women's team Treaty United W.F.C. was ready to enter the 2020 Women's National League season and the men's the 2020 League of Ireland First Division, but the men's team withdrew their licensing application for the 2020 season. The club went through the licensing procedures the following year however and on 20 February 2021 it was announced by the Football Association of Ireland that the club had been granted a licence and would take part in the 2021 League of Ireland First Division, taking the place of Shamrock Rovers II from the previous season. The club announced their 26 man first team squad and backroom staff for their first season in football under manager Tommy Barrett on 27 February 2021. They also announced that the number 4 shirt would be retired as a mark of respect to former Limerick United captain Joe O'Mahony. The club's first ever match was a 1–1 draw with Waterford in a pre-season friendly on 2 March 2021, with Limerick local Joel Coustrain getting the honour of scoring the club's first goal.",

The club joined the league after being awarded a First Division licence for the 2007 League of Ireland season. The opportunity to join the League of Ireland arose as Dublin City became bankrupt before the end of the 2006 season, leaving an uneven number of clubs. The 2007 season coincided with the takeover of the running of the league by the FAI and all existing clubs had to apply for entry into what was effectively a new league. Limerick was the only existing club refused a licence and so Wexford Youths and Limerick 37 were admitted to the new league. The club alternate their colours between plain black and pink and black. The club rebranded for the start of the 2017 season by dropping the 'Youths' from their title and changing the club crest.",
