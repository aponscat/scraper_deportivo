            "strDescriptionEN": "A.F.C. Telford United is a football club based in Telford, Shropshire, England. The club was formed in 2004 after the original Telford United, founded in 1872, folded due to financial problems. Currently members of the National League North, the sixth tier of English football, they play home matches at the New Bucks Head in Wellington, part of the new town of Telford. Their colours are white with navy blue and red trim.\r\n\r\nTelford United, then playing in the Football Conference, experienced severe financial difficulties towards the end of the 2003–04 season following the collapse of the Miras Contracts business of chairman and sole shareholder Andy Shaw. The club went into administration, and although supporters raised around £50,000 in two months, the club's debts totalled over £4 million, resulting in liquidation on 27 May 2004. On the same day, Telford United Supporters Limited announced that a new club would be formed, which was named A.F.C. Telford United; a new club motto, numquam obliviscere (never forget) was also adopted. In June the new club were placed in Division One of the Northern Premier League by the Football Association. Bernard McNally was appointed as manager and a new squad assembled.\r\n\r\nThe new club's first season saw them finish third in Division One, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. After beating Eastwood Town 1–0 in the semi-final, they defeated Kendal Town 2–1 in the final to earn promotion to the Premier Division. The attendance of 4,215 for the final was a club record. The following season saw them finish tenth. During the season, McNally was replaced as manager by Rob Smith. In 2006–07 the club finished third, having missed the chance to win the league when they lost 2–1 at home to eventual champions Burscough on the final day; the attendance of 5,710 being a new club record. However, they qualified for the promotion play-offs, and a 2–0 win over Marine in the semi-final, they defeated Witton Albion 3–1 to earn promotion to the Conference North.\r\n\r\nTelford finished second in the Conference North in 2007–08, again qualifying for the playoffs, in which they lost 4–0 on aggregate to Barrow. The 2008–09 season resulted in a fourth-place finish and another play-off campaign. After beating Alfreton Town 5–4 on aggregate in the semi-finals (a 2–0 win at home and a 4–3 defeat away), they lost 1–0 to Gateshead. The season also saw them reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, where they were drawn at home to Football League club Southend United. Following a 2–2 draw, the club lost 2–0 in the replay. In the FA Trophy they reached the semi-finals, losing 4–2 on aggregate to York City. However, they were victorious in the Conference League Cup, beating Forest Green Rovers 3–0 on penalties after a 0–0 draw.\r\n\r\nIn 2009–10 Telford finished eleventh in the league, resulting in the sacking of Smith and his replacement with Andy Sinton. Sinton's first season saw them finish as runners-up again. In the play-offs they defeated Nuneaton Town 3–2 on aggregate in the semi-final, before beating Guiseley 3–2 in the final with an injury-time winner by Phil Trainer, earning promotion to the Conference National. They also reached the first round of the FA Cup again, losing 3–1 at home to Lincoln City.\r\n\r\nThe 2011–12 season saw Telford finish twentieth, one place above the relegation zone. Another appearance in the first round of the FA Cup resulted in a 4–0 defeat at Chelmsford City. Sinton left the club mid-way through the following season, and was replaced by Mark Cooper, who remained in charge for only six games, before resigning to take a coaching role at Swindon Town. He was replaced by Graham Hyde, who lasted just two games, resigning after a defeat to Macclesfield Town. John Psaras took over for the remainder of the season, which saw them finish bottom of the division and be relegated to the Conference North. Liam Watson was appointed as manager in May 2013.\r\n\r\nIn 2013–14 Telford won the Conference North, earning an immediate return to the Conference Premier. However, the following season Watson was sacked in December with the club bottom of the division and replaced by Steve Kittrick. They finished 23rd, resulting in relegation back to the North division. However, the season also saw them reach the second round of the FA Cup for the first time; after beating Basingstoke Town 2–1 in a first round replay, they lost 1–0 at Bristol City. In August 2015 Kittrick was sacked and Rob Smith returned for a second spell as manager. They reached the first round of the FA Cup again in 2017–18 but lost 1–0 at Hereford.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "AFC Wimbledon is an English professional football club, based in Merton, London, which has played in League One, the third tier of the English football league system, since winning promotion in 2016. The club's home stadium is Plough Lane.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 2002 by former supporters of Wimbledon F.C. after the Football Association allowed that club to relocate to Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, about 60 miles (97 km) north of Wimbledon. Most of the Wimbledon F.C. supporters were very strongly opposed to moving the club so far away from Wimbledon, feeling that a club transplanted to a distant location would no longer represent Wimbledon or the club's historic legacy and tradition. Wimbledon F.C. moved in 2003 and formally changed the name of the club to Milton Keynes Dons in 2004.\r\n\r\nWhen AFC Wimbledon was formed, it affiliated to both the London and Surrey Football Associations, and entered the Premier Division of the Combined Counties League, the ninth tier of English football. The club has since been promoted six times in 13 seasons, going from the ninth tier (Combined Counties Premier) to the third (League One).\r\n\r\nAFC Wimbledon currently hold the record for the longest unbeaten run of league matches in English senior football, having played 78 consecutive league games without a defeat between February 2003 and December 2004. They are the first club formed in the 21st century to make it into the Football League.\r\n\r\nThe club was initially based at Kingsmeadow, a ground bought from and then shared with Isthmian League club Kingstonian F.C. until 2017, and with Chelsea F.C. Women from 2017. In November 2020, the club moved to Plough Lane, a new stadium on the site of the defunct Wimbledon Greyhound Stadium, only 250 yards away from the original Plough Lane, Wimbledon F.C.'s home until 1991. The new stadium has an initial capacity of 9,300, with the option of expansion to a maximum 20,000 at a later date.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Aldershot Town Football Club is an English association football club based in Aldershot, Hampshire. The club participates in the Conference Premier, the fifth tier of English football. The club was founded in the spring of 1992 after the closure of debt-ridden Fourth Division club Aldershot F.C..\r\n\r\nAldershot Town play at the Recreation Ground in Aldershot. They competed in Football League Two from 2008 to 2013 but were relegated from the Football League at the end of the 2012–13 season. Aldershot Town entered administration on 2 May 2013.\r\n\r\nIn March 1992, the town of Aldershot was without a football club after Aldershot F.C. became the first Football League team to fold during the football season since Accrington Stanley in 1962. Aldershot Town was born later the same year, and began life competing in the Isthmian League Division Three. Despite Aldershot Town playing five divisions lower than the Football League, the attendance for their first competitive fixture was higher than the old team's last home tie. Ten successive victories were recorded under the guidance of former player Steve Wignall and Aldershot won the championship by an 18-point margin.\r\n\r\nA further promotion and an FA Vase quarter-final placing was achieved in the 1993–94 season. When Steve Wignall departed to take charge of Colchester United mid-way through the 1994–95 season, former Nottingham Forest winger Steve Wigley took over. The club finished the 1994–95 season with a run of six successive victories, but missed out on promotion by goal difference. After narrowly missing out during the next two seasons Wigley left in July 1997 to become Youth Development Officer at Nottingham Forest. He was replaced by George Borg. Attendances continued to rise during this period and the final fixture of the 1997–98 Isthmian League First Division championship-winning season, at home to Berkhamsted Town, attracted 4,289 people to the Recreation Ground – a league record. The success under Borg continued with an Isthmian League Cup, two Hampshire Senior Cups and a runners-up spot in the Isthmian League Premier Division.\r\n\r\nThe club's reserves were reinstated in 2000–01 and entered the Suburban League. The FA Cup in 2000–01 saw Aldershot take on league opposition at The Recreation Ground for the first time since reforming, when Brighton & Hove Albion visited for a 1st Round tie in November and a record attendance of 7,500 saw the league team win. In the following season's FA Cup the Shots held Bristol Rovers to a home draw in the First Round, but again missed out on the Second Round after losing the replay in Bristol.\r\n\r\nGeorge Borg resigned as manager in November 2001 after pressure from supporters and was replaced by Terry Brown. He won his first game in charge beating Newport IOW 1–0 in the Hampshire Senior Cup Semi-final Second Leg, taking The Shots on to win the final against Havant & Waterlooville. In Brown's first full season in charge he overhauled the squad, and by mid-November the Shots were top of the table, a position they did not relinquish for the remainder of the season, winning promotion to the Football Conference. The club also retained the Hampshire Senior Cup with a 2–1 win over Bashley.",

They are members of the Hellenic Football League Premier Division.\r\nFounded in 1945, Ardley spent the majority of their early years in local competitions, primarily the Lord Jersey FA league and cup events. They stepped up in 1988 to the Oxfordshire Senior League and won Division One at the first attempt, gaining promotion to the Premier Division. Within two seasons, they had won that Division as well. The club stayed in the Oxfordshire league for two more seasons, until in 1993 they joined the Hellenic League.\r\n\r\nSince joining the Hellenic League, they have won the Division One Championship twice and been runner-up twice more, until finally gaining promotion to the Premier Division in 2003. The previous basic nature of the club's ground had prevented promotion in previous years. After upgrading the facilities enough to be awarded the \"Most Improved Ground\" award from The Non-League Paper in 2005, the ground was also deemed acceptable for entry to the FA Vase for the first time. In 2008 they appointed the former Banbury United manager Kevin Brock (ex-Oxford United and Newcastle United) as manager.",

Relegated only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division, and have won the second-most top-flight matches in English football history. In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In 1970–71, they won their first League and FA Cup Double. Between 1989 and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles. They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position.\r\n\r\nHerbert Chapman won Arsenal's first national trophies, but died prematurely. He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights, and shirt numbers, and added the white sleeves and brighter red to the club's kit. Arsène Wenger was the longest-serving manager and won the most trophies. He won a record 7 FA Cups, and his title-winning team set an English record for the longest top-flight unbeaten league run at 49 games between 2003 and 2004, receiving the nickname The Invincibles.\r\n\r\nIn 1886, Woolwich munitions workers founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913, the club crossed the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, becoming close neighbours of Tottenham Hotspur, and creating the North London derby. In 2006, they moved to the nearby Emirates Stadium. In terms of revenue, Arsenal is the ninth highest-earning football club in the world, earned €487.6m in 2016–17 season. Based on social media activity from 2014 to 2015, Arsenal's fanbase is the fifth largest in the world.

Milita nella massima serie del calcio inglese ininterrottamente dal 1919-1920, risultando quindi la squadra da più tempo presente in First Division\/Premier League. È la prima squadra della capitale del Regno Unito per successi sportivi e, in ambito federale, la terza dopo Manchester United e Liverpool, essendosi aggiudicata nel corso della sua storia tredici campionati inglesi, dodici FA Cup (record di vittorie, condiviso con il Manchester United), due League Cup e quattordici Community Shield (una condivisa),[5] mentre in ambito internazionale ha conquistato una Coppa delle Coppe ed una Coppa delle Fiere. Inoltre è una delle tredici squadre che hanno raggiunto le finali di tutte le tre principali competizioni gestite dalla UEFA: Champions League (2005-2006), Coppa UEFA (1999-2000) e Coppa delle Coppe (1979-1980, 1993-1994 e 1994-1995).[6]\r\n\r\nI colori sociali, rosso per la maglietta e bianco per i pantaloncini, hanno subìto variazioni più o meno evidenti nel corso degli anni.

            "strDescriptionEN": "Ashington Association Football Club is a football club based in Ashington, Northumberland, England. They are currently members of the Northern League Division One and play at Woodhorn Lane.\r\n\r\nFormed in 1883, the club have played in a number of local and regional leagues, including the Northern Alliance, the East Northumberland League, the North Eastern League, the Midland League, Wearside League and the North Regional League. They were a founding member of the Football League Third Division North in 1921 and are the northernmost team to have played in the Football League. The club were later founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968 and have been in the Northern League since 1970.\r\n\r\nThe club was established in 1883 and began entering the FA Cup in 1887. They joined the Northern Alliance at the start of the 1892–93 season when the league was expanded to twelve clubs. However, the league was reduced to ten club the following season, and as they had finished in the bottom two, Ashington were asked to leave. The club then ceased activities, but were brought back following a large meeting, joining the East Northumberland League in 1895. They went on to win the league title in 1897–98.\r\n\r\nAshington applied to rejoin the Northern Alliance in 1901, but were rejected. However, the following season they were elected back into the league, finishing second in the vote to admit three clubs. They won the league in 1913–14 and moved up to the North Eastern League. When football resumed after World War I the club rejoined the North Eastern League, where they remained until being elected into the new Third Division North of the Football League in 1921. After all the applications had been considered by the League, Ashington were one of fourteen clubs marked out for admission in a single bloc, which they duly were. In 1926–27 the club recorded its best performance in the FA Cup, reaching the third round, where they lost 2–0 at home to Nottingham Forest. After finishing bottom of the division in 1928–29 the club lost their bid for re-election, receiving only 14 votes to the 24 received by non-League York City.\r\n\r\nAshington subsequently dropped into Division Two of the North Eastern League as Division One had no spaces. With only two clubs eligible for promotion, Ashington appeared to have missed out after finishing third. However, runners-up White-le-Head declined the opportunity of promotion, allowing Ashington to move up to Division One. Five years later the league was reduced to a single division, where they remained until the league folded in 1958 due to the resignation of the Football League clubs' reserve teams, unsuccessfully applying for election to the Football League in 1947 (when no vote took place) and 1950 (when they received no votes).\r\n\r\nAlongside several other former North Eastern League clubs, Ashington switched to the Midland League. In 1960 they were founder members of the Northern Counties League, finishing as runners-up in its first season. The North Eastern League was re-established in 1962, but lasted only two seasons. Ashington spent the 1964–65 season in the Wearside League before joining the North Regional League, which was largely composed of Football League reserve teams. They remained in the league for three seasons, before becoming founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968. In the first season of the league, the club finished third-from-bottom and resigned due to the costs of being in the league. They spent a single season back in the Northern Alliance, before joining the Northern League in 1970. In 1973–74 they reached the semi-finals of the last-ever FA Amateur Cup, losing 3–0 to eventual winners Bishop's Stortford in a replay.\r\n\r\nIn 1981 a second division was added to the league, with Ashington remaining in Division One. However, after finishing second-from-bottom in 1983–84 they were relegated to Division Two. In 2000–01 they won Division Two, earning promotion to Division One. However, they spent only a single season in Division One before being relegated back to Division Two. After finishing fifth in 2002–03, they won Division Two again in 2003–04 and were promoted back to Division One. In 2012–13 they won the Northumberland Senior Cup for the tenth time with a 3–0 win over Whitley Bay.Ashington Association Football Club is a football club based in Ashington, Northumberland, England.

            "strDescriptionEN": "Ashton United Football Club is a football club, based in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, England. They are currently members of the Northern Premier League Premier Division and play at Hurst Cross.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1878 as Hurst Football Club and the earliest known match report dates back to a game against Hurst Red Star on 16 March 1879. They originally played in black-and-white stripes and were nicknamed the Lambs. The club first entered the FA Cup in 1883, beating Turton 3–1 in the first round, and then Irwell Springs 3–2 in the second. However, the result was annulled after a protest from Irwell, and it was they who advanced to the third round after Hurst refused to play the replay. In 1885 they won the first edition of the Manchester Senior Cup, beating Newton Heath (now Manchester United) 3–0 in the final. In the same year they reached the second round of the FA Cup again. However, although they defeated Halliwell 3–1, the result was annulled again. Ashton refused to play the replay and Halliwell advanced to the third round.\r\n\r\nThey joined the Ashton & District League in 1891, but after finishing ninth in the league in the 1891–92 season, it was reported in June 1892 that the club had folded. They were reformed in 1909, and were admitted to the Manchester League as it was expanded from 16 to 18 clubs. In their first season in the league, they finished level on points at the top of the table with Salford United, resulting in a play-off for the championship, which Salford won 2–1.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing sixth in 1910–11, Hurst won the title in 1911–12 and subsequently joined Division Two of the Lancashire Combination. Although they only finished fifth in 1912–13, they were promoted to Division One of the league for the 1913–14 season. Due to the outbreak of World War I, the club did not compete in 1915–16, but re-entered a wartime edition of the league for the 1916–17 season, winning the title. However, they did not compete during the following season. They resumed in the Lancashire Combination in 1918–19, but switched to the Cheshire County League in 1923. Players started wearing red shirts, earning the club a new nickname – the Robins.\r\n\r\nShortly before World War II, the club signed Dixie Dean, but the outbreak of hostilities limited him to a handful of appearances for the club. Following the war, the club resumed playing in the Cheshire County League for the 1945–46 season, changing their name to Ashton United on 1 February 1947. Despite finishing second bottom of the league in 1946–47, they applied for election to the Football League, but the four Football League clubs were re-elected without a vote being taken. They subsequently rejoined the Lancashire Combination in 1948 and were placed in Division One.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing twelfth in 1960–61, the club resigned from the league in order to apply to rejoin the Cheshire County League; in a ballot, they defeated by Altrincham and Wigan Athletic, and so had to rejoin the Lancashire Combination. However, Division One was now full, so the club had to drop into Division Two, which they won in 1961–62 to earn promotion back to Division One.\r\n\r\nIn 1964 the club switched to the Midland Counties League, where they played for two seasons before moving back to Division Two of the Lancashire Combination in 1966. Two seasons later, they moved across to the Cheshire County League, where they remained until it merged with the Lancashire Combination to form the North West Counties League in 1982. The club were placed in Division One of the new league, but were relegated to Division Two after finishing second-from-bottom in 1983–84. After winning Division Two in 1987–88 they were promoted back to Division One.\r\n\r\nThe 1991–92 season saw the club win the Division One title, earning promotion to Division One of the Northern Premier League. They remained in the division until a third-place finish in 2001–02 saw them qualify for the promotion play-offs. After a 3–1 win over Spennymoor United in the semi-finals, a 2–1 win over Bamber Bridge in the final saw them promoted to the Premier Division. During the season, Ashton's Gareth Morris scored one of the fastest goals in FA Cup history, netting after only four seconds against Skelmersdale United.\r\n\r\nWith the creation of the Conference North in 2004, a 14th-place finish in 2003–04 saw the club play-off against Hyde United and Bradford Park Avenue for the right to play in the new league. Following a 2–1 win over Hyde, they lost 2–1 to Bradford Park Avenue in the final. However, after Hucknall Town were denied promotion due to ground grading issues, Ashton took their place in the Conference North. The following season saw them finish second-from-bottom, resulting in relegation back to the Northern Premier League's Premier Division. In 2010 the club were ordered to pay £32,000 to Marcus Hallows after he was injured playing against Ashton for Altrincham.\r\n\r\nIn 2011 the club won the Northern Premier League Challenge Cup, beating Northwich Victoria 1–0 in the final. After finishing fifth in 2013–14 the club qualified for the promotion play-offs; however, after beating FC United 2–1 after extra time, they lost the final to AFC Fylde on penalties after a 1–1 draw. The 2014–15 season saw a third-place finish, again qualifying for the promotion play-offs, in which they lost on penalties to local rivals Curzon Ashton after a 1–1 draw. A third consecutive play-off campaign followed a fourth-place finish in 2015–16, but saw the club lose 3–1 to Salford City in the semi-finals.",

            "strDescriptionIT": "L'Aston Villa Football Club, noto semplicemente come Aston Villa,[1] è una società calcistica inglese con sede nel quartiere di Aston della città di Birmingham. Milita in Premier League, la massima serie del campionato inglese di calcio.\r\n\r\nFondato nel 1874, gioca nell'attuale stadio, il Villa Park, dal 1897. Fu tra i membri fondatori della Football League nel 1888 e della Premier League nel 1992.[2] Nel luglio 2018 l'egiziano Nassef Sawiris ha sostituito Tony Xia nel ruolo di presidente, in seguito all'acquisizione di una quota di controllo del 55% da parte di NSWE, una società posseduta e controllata congiuntamente dal gruppo di Sawiris NNS e dal miliardario americano Wes Edens[3]. Nell'agosto 2019, le azioni rimanenti di Tony Xia sono state acquistate dalla NSWE, che ha assunto quindi il pieno controllo del club.[4]\r\n\r\nL'Aston Villa è uno dei più antichi e vincenti club d'Inghilterra. È inoltre una delle cinque squadre inglesi ad essersi aggiudicato la Coppa dei Campioni\/Champions League.[5] È l’ottavo club inglese per successi calcistici (dopo Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Tottenham e Everton), avendo ottenuto 23 trofei principali,[6] anche se la maggior parte di questi arrivarono prima della Seconda guerra mondiale. È la seconda squadra per numero di stagioni in First Division\/Premier League, dietro all'Everton e davanti al Liverpool.\r\n\r\nLa squadra ha una antichissima rivalità con il Birmingham City, altro club della città, e con le altre squadre della contea delle West Midlands (West Bromwich Albion, Wolverhampton, Coventry City e Walsall). Il primo derby di Birmingham, giocato nel 1879, ha visto la vittoria finale dell'Aston Villa per 1-0.[7]\r\n\r\nI colori tradizionali del club sono il bordeaux ed il celeste (in inglese claret & blue). Diversi sono stati gli stemmi utilizzati, tutti caratterizzati dalla presenza di un leone rampante. Lo storico simbolo circolare della squadra che vinse la Coppa dei Campioni 1981-1982 fu sostituito qualche anno più tardi da uno scudo a righe bordeaux e celesti con il leone al centro. Nel 2007 lo stemma venne ulteriormente modificato inserendo il leone d'oro rampante su uno sfondo celeste; nella parte inferiore il motto Prepared. Nel 2016 è stato tolto il motto Prepared ed il leone è stato aumentato nelle dimensioni.[8]",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Atherstone Town Community Football Club is a football club based in Atherstone, Warwickshire, England. They are currently members of the Midland League Premier Division and play at Sheepy Road.\r\n\r\nThe original club was formed in 1887. They reached the semi-finals of the FA Amateur Cup in 1907–08, losing 3–0 to Stockton. The following season saw them reach the semi-final stage again, this time losing 3–0 to Clapton. After playing in several local leagues, they joined the Birmingham Combination in 1911, and were runners-up in their first season in the league. The club finished bottom of the league in 1923–24 and again in 1928–29. Following World War II, they were league champions in 1947–48, also winning the Birmingham Senior Cup. When the Combination folded in 1954, all but one of the clubs joined the Birmingham & District League, with Atherstone placed in the transitional Northern Division. A fourteenth-place finish in 1954–55 saw them placed in Division Two for the following season. They went on to finish as runners-up in Division Two, and were promoted to Division One.\r\n\r\nAtherstone finished bottom of Division One in 1957–58 and were relegated back to Division Two. However, they finished third in Division Two the following season and were promoted to Division One. The league was reduced to a single division in 1960, and was renamed the West Midlands (Regional) League in 1962. When it expanded in 1965, Atherstone became members of the Premier Division. They were runners-up in the division in 1971–72 and were promoted to Division One North of the Southern League. After finishing as runners-up in Division One North the following season, the club were promoted to the Premier Division, where they remained until folding at the end of the 1978–79 season.\r\n\r\nThe club was immediately reformed as Atherstone United, taking the reserve team's place in Division One of the West Midlands (Regional) League. They were Division One champions in 1981–82, earning promotion to the Premier Division. After winning the Premier Division title in 1986–87, the club were promoted to the Midland Division of the Southern League. The following season saw them reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, eventually losing 2–0 to VS Rugby in a first round replay. They were Midland Division runners-up in 1988–89, securing promotion to the Premier Division. In 1990–91 the club reached the FA Cup first round again; after beating Fleetwood Town 3–1 in the first round, they lost 1–0 at Third Division Crewe Alexandra in the second round. Another FA Cup first round appearance the following season saw them hold Fourth Division Hereford United to a 0–0 draw at Sheepy Road, before losing the replay at Edgar Street 3–0.\r\n\r\nAtherstone finished bottom of the Southern League Premier Division in 1999–2000 season and were relegated to the Western Division. They subsequently folded midway through the 2003–04 season. The club was then reformed under the name Atherstone Town, joining Division One of the Midland Combination for the 2004–05 season. After winning Division One and the President's Cup in their first season, they were Premier Division champions and League Cup winners in 2005–06 and were promoted to the Midland Alliance. The club were Midland Alliance champions in 2007–08, earning promotion to Division One Midlands of the Southern League. In 2008–09 they finished third in the division, qualifying for the promotion play-offs, but lost the semi-final 5–0 to Chasetown\r\n\r\nDivision One Midlands was renamed Division One Central in 2010, and Atherstone were relegated back to the Midland Alliance at the end of the 2010–11 season after finishing second-from-bottom of the division. They suffered a second successive relegation after finishing second-from-bottom of the Midland Alliance the following season, returning to the Premier Division of the Midland Combination. When the Combination merged with the Midland Alliance to form the Midland League in 2014, Atherstone were placed in Division One. In 2021–22 they were Division One champions, earning promotion to the Premier Division",

They are currently members of the Isthmian League North Division and play at Parkside.\r\n\r\nThe club was established in 1927 and played in local leagues until World War II. In 1946 they joined the Thurrock Combination League, and went on to win the Essex Junior Cup in 1948 and 1949. In 1949 the club joined Division Two of the London League. They finished fourth in their first season, and were promoted to Division One. The following season they won Division One, but were not promoted to the Premier Division. However, despite finishing ninth in 1952–53, they were promoted. After finishing seventh, then third in their first two seasons in the Premier Division, they won the division in 1954–55. In 1957 the club switched to the Delphian League, finishing as runners-up in their first season. When the league folded in 1963 they joined Division Two of the Athenian League. After finishing second in 1968–69, the club was promoted to Division One. They won the Division One title in 1970–71, earning promotion to the Premier Division.\r\n\r\nIn 1973 Aveley joined Division Two of the Isthmian League, which became Division One in 1977. They won the Essex Thameside Trophy in 1979–80 and the Hornchurch Charity Cup in 1982–83. In 1985–86 they finished bottom of the division, and were relegated to Division Two North. After finishing second in 1989–90, a season in which they also became the first club from the bottom division to win the League Cup, the club was promoted back to Division One. Although they finished fourth in their first season back in Division One, the club finished bottom of the division the following season, but were not relegated. However, in 1992–93 they finished bottom again and were relegated to Division Two. In 1994–95 the club were relegated to Division Three, where they remained until 2002, when league reorganisation saw them placed in Division One North.\r\n\r\nAveley were transferred to Division One East of the Southern League in 2004, before returning to Division One North of the Isthmian League in 2006. They won the division in 2008–09, and were promoted to the Premier Division. After finishing third in Isthmian League under manager Rod Stringer, the club lost in the promotion play-off semi-finals to eventual winners Boreham Wood. In 2011–12 the club were relegated back to Division One North after finishing third-from-bottom. In their first season in Division One they finished fifth and qualified for the promotion play-offs. They lost 3–1 to Maldon & Tiptree in the semi-finals.",
