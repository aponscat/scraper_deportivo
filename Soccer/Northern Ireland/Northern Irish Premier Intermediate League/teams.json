As a result, they were deducted all the points they gained in the matches the player took part in, and finished in 4th place instead of 1st. The club appealed the decision, and took their case all the way to the High Court, but it was dismissed. Had they won their case they would have been promoted, with Chimney Corner being relegated. Tandragee Rovers were crowned champions of the division instead, but did not apply for entry to the Championship.\r\n\r\nIn the 2012â€“13 season, they narrowly missed out on a place in Championship 2 again. After winning the league title, they faced Northern Amateur Football League champions Newington in a two-legged play-off for promotion, and lost the tie on the away goals rule after it finished 4â€“4 on aggregate. A 3â€“2 home win followed by a 2â€“1 away defeat was not enough, and Newington were promoted at Dollingstown's expense.\r\n\r\nIn the 2013â€“14 season, the club finally secured promotion to the NIFL Championship after winning a play-off against Brantwood. After losing the first leg 2â€“1 at Skegoneill Avenue, Dollingstown won the second leg 5â€“2 at Planters Park to ensure a 6â€“4 victory on aggregate. As a result, they were promoted to NIFL Championship 2 in place of Killymoon Rangers, who had finished bottom of Championship 2. They became the first club relegated from Championship 2 since its inauguration in 2009.\r\n\r\nIn 2016 the club was relegated from the Northern Ireland Football League but as of 2017-18 season were promoted back into the league after winning Intermediate A at a canter.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Knockbreda Football Club (formerly Knockbreda Parish) is a semi-professional, Northern Irish football club playing in the NIFL Championship. They hail from Belfast and play their home matches at Breda Park, on the Upper Braniel Road located in the east of the city. The club was formed after the Second World War, c. 1948. and played in the Irish Churches' League before joining the Northern Amateur Football League in 1989. Intermediate status was achieved on promotion to Division 1B in 1997. In 2009, the club was admitted to the IFA Championship\r\n\r\nKnockbreda Football Club was formed in 1947. Originally Knockbreda Parish, they played their football for 42 years in the Irish Churches' League, before joining the Northern Amateur Football League in 1989. Starting in Division 2C, â€˜Breda won promotion of 2A in the first three seasons.\r\n\r\nOff the field, the committee realised they would have to make some major changes in order to become an Intermediate Club. In 1996, they acquired the current facilities at Upper Braniel, and after winning 2A, were promoted to 1B that same season. Promotion to 1A soon followed, and the club enjoyed a three-year stint at that level, before joining the Premier Division in 2000. After relegation in 2007, the club spent a year in 1A before promotion to the re-vamped IFA Championship 2 in 2009. During the spell in the NIAL, the club won the Clarence Cup twice, the Border Cup once, but by far the greatest success was the WKD Irish Intermediate Cup in 2009. The early driving force behind the club was one of its founders, Fred Duke who died in 2010. For the last two decades the club's main driving force, beginning in the Churches' League right up the IFA Championship, has been one of the current directors and Secretary, Colin Russell.\r\n\r\nAfter four years in Championship 2, in 2012â€“13 the club won promotion to Championship 1 for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe club remained In promotion contention remarkably in the NIFL Championship 1 In the seasons following their return to the division.",

However, the club is still colloquially referred to as \"Distillery\". The club colour is white.

            "strDescriptionEN": "Moyola Park Association Football Club is an intermediate, Northern Irish football club playing in the NIFL Premier Intermediate League. The club, founded in 1880, hails from Castledawson, near Magherafelt, County Londonderry, and plays its home matches at the Mill Meadow, which has an artificial \"3G\" surface. Club colours are royal blue and yellow. They are currently managed by Mervyn Pattison. The club won the inaugural Irish Cup in 1881.\r\n\r\nMoyola Park was formed during season 1879â€“80 under the patronage of Lord Spencer Chichester, the landlord of the Moyola Park estate. The first recorded game was a friendly at home against Cliftonville, on 14 February 1880, in which the visitors recorded a 3-0 victory. Lord Spencer Chichester was the inaugural president of the Irish Football Association, which was formed in November 1880. On 9 April 1881, Moyola Park became the first winners of the Irish Cup, defeating Cliftonville 1â€“0 in the final.\r\n\r\nAfter those prestigious early days the club became less prominent and did not become a senior club, playing as a junior club outside the Irish League. In the early years of the twentieth century, the club played in a local league in south Londonderry and it continued to do so until the Second World War, with the exception of the 1929â€“30 season during which the club participated in the Belfast-based Minor League. After the war, Moyola Park was a founding member of the Ballymena and District Junior League in 1948â€“49, where it played until season 1977â€“78 (with the exception of 1950â€“51, when it participated in the Irish Football Alliance). During this time, the club won the league championship outright on five occasions: 1948â€“49, 1949â€“50, 1973â€“74, 1976â€“77, 1977â€“78, and shared the championship in 1959â€“60 with Ballymoney United. The club also won the Irish Junior Cup in 1972â€“73 and 1973â€“74. During the 1970s the club was managed by a local ex footballer Billy Lennox with another local ex footballer Johnston Mawhinney Jnr. as his assistant when the aforementioned 3 league titles and 2 Irish Junior Cups were achieved representing notable success in that period of the Club's history.\r\n\r\nIn 1978, the club was elevated to intermediate status upon joining the newly established Northern Ireland Intermediate League. In 1991, Moyola Park gained admission to the Irish League B Division. A successful spell under manager Kenny Shiels saw the club win the Smirnoff Cup (1999â€“2000) and the Craig Memorial Cup (2000â€“01), and finished as runners-up in the (renamed) Second Division (2000â€“01) and Irish Intermediate Cup. The clubâ€™s greatest modern success followed in 2001â€“02 when, under new manager Eric Halliday, Moyola Park won the Second Division title (as well as retaining the Craig Memorial Cup.\r\n\r\nUntil the 2008â€“09 season, its home was the eponymous Moyola Park, but at the start of 2009â€“10 it used Coagh United's Hagan Park while its current ground was under construction. The first match at the new ground was on 16 January 2010 against Lurgan Celtic.",
