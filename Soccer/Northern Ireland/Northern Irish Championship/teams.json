            "strDescriptionEN": "Armagh City Football Club is an intermediate, Northern Irish football club playing in the NIFL Premier Intermediate League.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1964 as Milford Everton in the village of Milford, just outside Armagh city. The original name was in honour of the founders' favourite English team, Everton. Milford was the village were the penalty kick was first introduced in 1890 when local goalkeeper William McCrum suggested a way to combat illegal challenges near to goal. Milford Everton eventually bought and refurbished the McCrum Institute in the early 1980s as they strove to improve facilities for the 'B' Division. The club was renamed Armagh City after relocating to Armagh in 1988. They played at the Mill Field, Armagh from 1988 to 1993, when they moved to their current ground, Holm Park. They achieved senior status in 1999, but reverted to intermediate status in 2003 when the Irish Premier League was established and the number of senior clubs was reduced from 20 to 16. In 2005, however, City gained promotion to the Premier League, but after three more seasons at senior level, the club failed to gain a place in the 12-club IFA Premiership and reverted once more to intermediate status as a member of the IFA Championship. The club's colours are azure and black stripes. Former player Marty Rice was named first team manager on 10 July 2010, having been assistant to Ivor McGucken at the start of the 2009–10 season.\r\n\r\nDuring the 2011–12 season Armagh City entered into negotiations with various bodies including the IFA, Armagh City and District Council and SportNI to secure funding to replace their grass pitch with the latest, FIFA approved, 3rd generation pitch. The pitch was laid in summer 2013 and opened in September 2013. The first game for the first team was on 14 September 2013 - a 5–1 win against Lurgan Celtic in the Bob Radcliffe Cup.\r\n\r\nLuke Grimley was the last player to score on the old Holm Park in a 1-0 win over rivals Loughgall which clinched the Championship reserve league title managed by Mickey O’Neill and captained by Cillian Sheridan, while Shea McGerrigan was the first player to score in the new Holm Park with a 5-1 win over Lurgan Celtic.\r\n\r\nIn the 2011-12 season Armagh City F.C Youth (U18) created history by winning their first ever national trophy, the Harry Cavan Irish Youth Cup, defeating Cliftonville 1-0 in the final with a goal from Barry Quinn, the side was managed by John Hynds and Martin Grimley, and captained by Matthew Hynds. On the run to the final the Eagles defeated, Ballymoney United 9-0, Woodvale F.C 7-0 and Glenavon F.C 3-1. In a successful year for the youth side they also lifted the League title undefeated and the League Cup completing a impressive domestic treble.\r\n\r\nIn the 2013-14 season Armagh City F.C won the double by winning the league and Bob Radcliffe Cup, the side, captained by Liam Cullen also reached the Intermediate Cup Final but were defeated by Bangor F.C 2-1.\r\n\r\nThe club over the years has reached several Mid Ulster Cup finals with a reasonably large following and have came close to promotion to the NIFL Premiership. The club was relegated to the Premier Intermediate League in the 2016-17 season following a disappointing 7-1 loss to Newry City in the championship relegation play off over two legs. Manager Marty Rice then resigned.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2017 former Cliftonville player Joe Kerr took over as manager of the club for the 2017\/18 season with Alex Clifford and Mickey O'Neill as his assistants.",

The club hails from Ballyclare, County Antrim and plays its home matches at Dixon Park. Club colours are red and white. The club's rivals are Carrick Rangers and Larne and games between the three clubs are referred to as \"The East Antrim Derbies\".\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1919 by veterans of the First World War, most of them from \"C\" Company of the 12th Royal Irish Rifles – a battalion made up entirely of East Antrim men, who fought at the Somme and in many other famous First World War battles. From 1990 until 2003, the club enjoyed senior status, but reverted to intermediate status when the Irish Premier League was established and the number of senior clubs was reduced.\r\n\r\nThe club's reserve team play in the NIFL Development League for under 20s. The club also has a partnership with local youth club Ballyclare Colts, whose sides (from under 11 to under 15) provide players to progress to Comrades' own youth sides at under-17 and under-18 level. The under-18 side play in the IFA Youth League.\r\n\r\nThe club was relegated to IFA Championship 2 in the 2010–11 season and finished in 6th place in the 2011–12 season, but the following season brought promotion back to Championship 1 after finishing as runners-up behind Championship 2 winners Knockbreda. One of the clubs most famous products was Northern Ireland and Sunderland defender Paddy McNair who attends games when possible. Gareth McAuley, now of Rangers, and Michael Smith (Hearts) both played for the Comrades before switching to professional football.\r\n\r\nThe club finished an impressive 3rd in the 2016\/17 season, losing out in a promotion playoff to Institute. The club continues with the ambition of getting back into the NIFL Premiership.",

The current manager is Bryan McCarroll.\r\n\r\nDundela Football Club was formed in 1895 from employees of a local dairy owned by the Agnew family and members of a local harriers' club. Wilgar Park has been the home to the club since 1900. The park lies in the heartland of east Belfast, in a suburb named Strandtown. Its capacity is 2,500. The venue is nicknamed \"The Hen Run\". The club's greatest achievement to date came in April 1955, when it defeated Glenavon by three goals to nil at Windsor Park, Belfast in the final of the Irish Cup. Dundela's darkest hour occurred on 25 August 1995, when team captain, Michael Goddard died during a game at Stangmore Park, home of Dungannon Swifts, after being struck on the chest with the ball. The club's latest success was an Intermediate League title in the 2017-18 season. Dundela's local rivals are Harland & Wolff Welders.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Limavady United Football Club is an intermediate, Northern Irish football club playing in the NIFL Premier Intermediate League. The club comes from Limavady, County Londonderry, and plays home matches at the Showgrounds. Club colours are royal blue shirts with white trim, blue socks and royal blue shorts. Away colours are all yellow. The current manager is Lee Guy, who took over from Mark Clyde in 2020.\r\n\r\nThe club was formed in 1884 when Alexander (formed in 1880 by the Alexander Cricket Club, which itself was formed in 1878) amalgamated with another local club, Wanderers. Alexander had been a founder member of the Irish Football Association in 1880, contributing to the purchase of the original Irish Cup.\r\n\r\nNicknamed \"The Roesiders\" or \"The Lims\", in 1885 and 1886 the club reached consecutive Irish Cup Finals, losing both to Distillery - the first 3–0 and the second 1–0. After a protest by Limavady in 1886 the result was confirmed, but medals were withheld from both teams in spite of a challenge in the High Court by a Distillery player. Between 1882 and 1888, the club provided seven internationals to the Irish national football team. The club also famously travelled to Liverpool in 1886, and defeated Everton 1–0- the first team from outside Great Britain to do so.\r\n\r\nAfter a long time as a junior team, the club joined the senior Irish Football League in 1997–98, and reached its first Irish Cup semi-final in over a century in 2003–04. In 2008, the club lost its senior status when it failed to gain admission to the new IFA Premiership. Since then, the club played in the IFA Championship until relegation in May 2019.\r\n\r\nIn April 2013, three players received suspensions after being found guilty of breaching IFA betting rules on one of the club's league matches.\r\n\r\nThe club won the NIFL Championship 2 in the 2015-2016 season but were denied promotion to NIFL Championship 1 as they were unsuccessful in applying for a licence. However they were promoted as winners of the Premier Intermediate League in 2016-2017",

It is based in Newry, County Down and plays at the Showgrounds. The club's colours are blue and white, with striped jerseys and blue shorts.\r\n\r\nThe club was created in 2013 after the city's former semi-professional club, Newry City F.C. was dissolved in September 2012, when a winding-up petition brought against the club by former player and manager Gerry Flynn was granted, and the club decided not to appeal the decision. This led to the majority of Newry City's players leaving for Warrenpoint Town. The new club, wearing the same colours and having the same home as its predecessor, is regarded as a phoenix club, but has, and claims, no legal connection to the former club business.",
