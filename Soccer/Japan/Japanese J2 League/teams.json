The club currently play in Japan Football League, which is the 4th level in the Japanese football pyramid.\r\n\r\nIwaki FC was founded in 2012, before getting official recognition in 2013 with the creation of their homonymous corporation. The club name got more attention when Under Armour decided to join the club and support it to climb the Japanese football pyramid from the bottom. There had been a big vision behind the club, with the will of \"making Iwaki the central football-city in Tohoku\". In fact, a new training field opened in November 2016 and the club-house was just launched in May 2017: two central structures to rise to the top of Japanese football.\r\n\r\nPlus, results are pushing Iwaki FC, which has won several categories in Fukushima Prefectural Football League, coming to first division: the next target is Tohoku Soccer League, while the club has even achieved their first win at National Club Team Football Championship Tournament (winning the final 9–0). Iwaki FC also debuted at Emperor's Cup in 2017 edition. After defeating Norbritz Hokkaido in the first round, they surprisingly overcame Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo for 5–2 after extra-time. They lost against Shimizu S-Pulse in the third round, but it was still a surprising run.\r\n\r\nIn the 2019 season, Iwaki FC earned promotion to next year's JFL for the first time in history after two seasons in Tohoku Soccer League competition, with the club winning the All Japan Regional Promotion Series and as a result Iwaki was crowned champions.",

The club currently plays in J3 League.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a merged club had been discussed by the Toyama Prefectural Football Association as early as 2005, but discussions had come to nothing.\r\n\r\nOn September 10, 2007, YKK (owner of YKK AP SC) and Hokuriku Electric Power Company (owner of ALO's Hokuriku), agreed with merging their clubs to aim promotion to the J.League in response of eager request by the TPFA. According to Tulip TV, local broadcasting company, over 20 companies informally promised to invest in the new club. In the media briefing, the governor of Toyama Prefecture also participated.\r\n\r\nTPFA has founded an organization named \"Civic Football Club Team of Toyama Prefecture (富山県民サッカークラブチーム)\" with two major economic organization and representatives of Hokuriku Electric Power Company and YKK. The Japan Football League confirmed that the merged club would compete in the JFL from the 2008 season.\r\n\r\nThey applied for J.League Associate Membership in January 2008, then their application was accepted at the board meeting of J.League on February 19, 2008. On November 23 they secured qualification for promotion to the J2 League, and on December 1 promotion was made official by J.League.\r\n\r\nThe word \"kataller\" is a portmanteau of the phrase katare (勝たれ) which in Toyama dialect means \"to win\", and the French aller, \"to go\". The phrase is also intended to be a pun of Italian cantare, \"to sing\", and of native Japanese katare (語れ), \"to talk\" (written with a different kanji character).\r\n\r\nThe crest is shaped in the form of a tulip, the official Toyama Prefecture flower.",

The combined word expresses the will of the local citizens, companies, and government to support the team. Others connection to the italian culture can be found in the city nickname Azzurro (light blue in English).\r\n\r\nThe club's home ground is Ōita Bank Dome, also known as the \"Big Eye\", which was one the venues built for the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

The club currently plays in the J3 League, which is the third tier of football in the country. Roasso is a portmanteau of the Italian words rosso and asso, meaning \"red ace\".\r\n\r\nThe club was founded as the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation (Den-Den Kōsha, current NTT) Kumamoto Soccer Club in 1969. The club was promoted to the Kyushu Soccer League in 1983.\r\n\r\nAccording to the NTT's privatization in 1985, the club was renamed as NTT Kyushu Soccer Club in 1988. During the NTT Kyushu era, the club won five Kyushu Soccer League titles and one All Japan Senior Football Championship. The club changed their name again to NTT Kumamoto Football Club in 2000.\r\n\r\nThe club changed their name to NTT West Kumamoto Football Club in 2001 as the NTT was divided into NTT East and NTT West. The club was promoted to the JFL in 2001. The NTT relinquished the ownership of the club in 2002 and community-oriented Alouette Kumamoto Football Club was born. Alouette is a French word meaning skylark, the bird of Kumamoto Prefecture. The club finished at the 17th in this season and was relegated to the Kyushu Soccer League.\r\n\r\nThe club name changed again to Rosso Kumamoto in 2005. Rosso means red in Italian. After they won the Kyushu Soccer League and finished at the 3rd in the Regional League play-off tournament, the club was promoted to the JFL.\r\n\r\nThe club was recently featured in J.League programming to introduce the club to followers of the pro league. Rosso's second-place finish in the 2007 JFL season was high enough to earn promotion into the J.League (J2 League) for the 2008 season.\r\n\r\nThe club changed their name to current Roasso Kumamoto in 2008. The previous name Rosso was a registered trademark of another company and the club could not use it.",

This symbolises many small elements uniting to form one formidable object, for example as a metaphor for a team. Also, Sagan Tosu can be interpreted as \"Tosu of Saga (Prefecture)\" (佐賀ん鳥栖, Saga-n Tosu) in the area's dialect. In addition, it is widely believed that the word is meant to be a pun with Italian giants Juventus although the club hasn't confirmed it.",
