The club played in the Brunei Premier League in the early 2000s, winning the league title in 2002 and 2004.\r\n\r\nThe club then decided to play in Malaysia, and joined the Malaysian Premier League as a foreign-based team in for the 2005–06 season. They won promotion to the Malaysian Super League (the top tier of Malaysian football) at the end of their first season in Malaysian football, and then finished 3rd and 10th in the following two season in the Super League. The club then left the Malaysian league and joined Singapore's S.League for the 2009 season. They won the Singapore League Cup, but were forced to withdraw from the league competition five games before the end of the season after FIFA suspended the Football Association of Brunei Darussalam for government interference in its affairs, thus barring teams from Brunei from taking part in overseas competitions. All the club's league results for 2009 were therefore expunged. At the end of the suspension, they re-entered the S.League and won the title in 2015, just after a near-miss in 2014.\r\n\r\nDPMM FC is owned by the Crown Prince of Brunei, Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah, who previously played as a goalkeeper for the team, and is coached by Adrian Pennock since 2019.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, DPMM participated in the Singapore Premier League but could only play one game before the COVID-19 pandemic forced the league to be suspended until October. The team was unable to fulfill the remaining fixtures due to travel restrictions between Brunei and Singapore, resulting in the inevitable exclusion from the year's SPL season.\r\n\r\nDPMM will once again withdraw from the 2021 Singapore Premier League due to the ongoing travel restrictions imposed by the Brunei government, but not before showing intent to participate in the league.",
