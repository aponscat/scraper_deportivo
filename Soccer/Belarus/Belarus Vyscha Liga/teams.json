Their home stadium is Central Stadium.\r\n\r\nTeams from Gomel (usually city or raion selection or railway-based team Lokomotiv, but not always) played in Belarusian SSR championships since the early 1920s. In 1946 Belorusian SSR league for one season becomes one of the zones of USSR 3rd level league, and Lokomotiv Gomel became the first city team to play in Soviet league.\r\n\r\nThe modern Gomel team was founded in 1959 as Lokomotiv Gomel. They played at the 2nd level of Soviet football between 1959 and 1968. The results varied between seasons, as the team managed to finish 1st in their zone in 1962 as well as last in 1959 and 1963. However, because Soviet league system structure was changing almost every season in the 1950s and 60s, Lokomotiv wasn't promoted or relegated until another league reorganisation in 1969.\r\n\r\nGomselmash played at the 3rd level of Soviet football between 1969 and 1989, until further league reorganisation in 1990, after which the team was relegated to the 4th level.\r\n\r\nIn 1992 Gomselmash joined the newly formed Belarusian Premier League. The first years were unsuccessful and the team relegated in 1995. They changed name to the current one, FC Gomel, the same year. In 1998 Gomel returned to Premier League and achieved much better results than before (champions title in 2003, 2nd place in 2007 and 3rd in 1999). The team also won Belarusian Cup in 2002 and made it to the final in 2004.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, they played English club Liverpool in the UEFA Europa League qualifying rounds. In the first leg they lost 0–1 and lost again away at Anfield in the second leg 3–0.",

Since its foundation and until the dissolution of Soviet Union the team was playing in Belarusian SSR league. In 1988, they were renamed to Dnepr Rogachev (Dnyapro Rahachow, Belarusian: Дняпро Рагачоў).\r\n\r\nIn 1992, the team joined newly created Belarusian Second League, where they spent next six seasons. After successful 1996 season Dnepr was promoted to the First League. In 1998, they were renamed to FC Rogachev, in 2001, after partnering with local football academy, to Rogachev-DUSSh-1 and finally to Dnepr-DUSSh-1 Rogachev (Belarusian: Дняпро-ДЮСШ-1) in 2002.\r\n\r\nThe team spent nine seasons in First League until they finished at the last (16th) place in 2005 and were to be relegated back to the Second League. However, due to financial troubles, the team disbanded in early 2006.\r\n\r\nBetween 2007 and 2013 the amateur team representing Rogachev played in Gomel Oblast league.
