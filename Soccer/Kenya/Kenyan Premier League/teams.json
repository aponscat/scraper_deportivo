They have won the Kenyan Premier League a record 18 times, Five more than their arch-rivals A.F.C. Leopards, and have also won the FKF President's Cup a record 10 times. They are the only team from Kenya and the CECAFA region to win an African continental title to date, having won the African Cup Winners' Cup in 1987 after previously reaching the final in 1979.\r\n\r\nThe club was formally established on 17 February 1968 as a merger of Luo Union and Luo Sports Club (also known as Luo Stars) and won the national league at the first time of asking. Some of its original leaders were politicians Tom Mboya and Jaramogi Oginga Odinga. However the club was founded much earlier, in the 1915, and participated intermittently in local tournaments in Western Kenya. Various groups used this name at different times.\r\n\r\nThe club plays its home games at the Nairobi City Stadium. Alternatively they also play their home games at the Moi International Sports Centre and the Nyayo National Stadium. It has been proposed that the club hosts some of its home matches at its alternate stadiums in its earlier days, the renovated Kisumu County Stadium and the Mombasa Municipal Stadium.\r\n\r\nThe club won the Kenya National Football league in 1968, having been formally founded only in February of the same year. In 1976, Gor Mahia won the national league unbeaten, and repeated the same feat 39 years later under the leadership of Frank Nuttall.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the 2000s, Gor started bouncing back to fame steadily bringing Kenyan football fans back to the pitch and regularly filling sold-out stadiums. The club returned to silverware in 2008 when it won the KFF Cup after a thirteen-year drought of any major trophies. Gor proceeded to win the Kenya DSTV Super Cup against the year's defending champs, Mathare United before the beginning of the 2009 KPL season. On 26 October 2011 Gor Mahia in typically dominant fashion trounced Sofapaka to win the 2011 edition of the FKL Cup having dispatched their archrivals AFC Leopards 6 days earlier in a 20 October Heroes Day thriller.",

The points deducted from Kakamega Homeboyz left Zoo Kericho at the helm, with Shabana being named runners-up as a result of board room decisions. However, no team was promoted to the top league due to misunderstanding between Football Kenya Federation and Kenya Premier League Limited, a company mandated to run the top tier League. Nyamweya the corrupt (a title bestowed upon him by the Queen of Kenya), the President of Football Kenya Federation, also Patron of Shabana attempted to appease Kakamega Homeboyz by directing that together with Shabana and Zoo Kericho, Homeboyz be promoted to the top tier league.

            "strDescriptionEN": "Kariobangi Sharks Football Club commonly known as Sharks or K. Sharks is a Kenyan football club based in Nairobi and founded in the suburb of Kariobangi. The team plays in the KPL, the top tier of the Football Kenya Federation system Kariobangi Sharks was founded in the year 2000 and started in the lower cadres of the Nairobi league. The Kariobangi area was then an infamous crime hot spot in the city and sports, especially soccer which was the most famous one, was one of the escape routes for the youth trapped in the dangerous hustle and bustle.\r\n\r\nA set of young footballers used to play at the Holy Trinity Catholic Church, Kariobangi mostly after school going hours and during the weekends as a leisure activity. Their field was the church's basketball court made of concrete slab. The boys didn't have a coach or a leader and mostly played using worn out soccer balls usually mended by cobblers or at times they also used the lifundo, African name to the balls made by plastic bags and ropes.\r\n\r\nA young man by the name Nick Mwendwa, who lived just across the church would occasionally watch the boys play through the window of his house and he couldn't help but notice the talent there but he was also disturbed by how disorganized the boys looked as they would always argue and at times even prematurely end the game and go home angry.\r\n\r\nMwendwa then decided to come and offer the boys some guidance and assistance. He would dig into his savings and buy the boys three brand new soccer balls from the Nairobi Sports House. He then started training them every weekend when he wasn't going to work. They adopted the name Kariobangi Sharks FC. The founder Nick Mwendwa doubled up as team coach and manager.\r\n\r\nMost of the boys played barefoot since they lacked playing shoes while other used worn out sport shoes. At that time due to lack of training kits, training session teams were distinguished by one team taking off their shirts and the other playing with their shirts on.\r\n\r\nAfter a year of playing local tournaments, Nick Mwendwa finally registered the team with Kenya Football Federation at around February 2001 making them eligible of playing in the lowest tier at the country starting with Nairobi Province League. With the little savings from his earning, Mwendwa would cater for the team transport to honor league matches. At times when it wasn't enough the young boys would pool together fare for one way while Mwendwa would pay for the other way. They used the popular public transport known as matatu in Nairobi. Top performances at the Nairobi League then earned the team promotion to the Division II which was the lowest national football tier. In 2011 the club was promoted to the KFF nationwide league just before the Unified elections and subsequently played in the unified Division I league then joining the newly formed National Super league in 2013.\r\n\r\nIn the final match of the 2015- 2016 National Super League (NSL) season, Kariobangi sharks beat Nzoia United to secure the team's promotion to the KPL. Lone goal from Patillah Omotto, a sharks homegrown player and captain guaranteed Kariobangi sharks a berth in the 2017 Kenya premier league\r\n\r\nIn 2017, the team reached the Federation Cup final for the very first time in what was also the first season at the top tier league but lost 2-0 to AFC Leopards. The team would however finish an impressive 3rd place in the league, marking a wonderful debut season at the Kenyan Premier League.\r\n\r\nThat year also saw the team produce the league Top Scorer, Masud Juma (17 goals) and the league Top goalkeeper John Oyemba who kept 16 clean sheets, more than any other keeper. Coach William “Kanu” Muluhya was also voted the coach of the year. Midfielder Sven Yidah was also nominated among the league's New Player of the Year.\r\n\r\nIn 2018 the team won their first major trophy as they returned to the Federation Cup final again beating Sofapaka FC 3-2 with a brace from Ugandan striker George Abege and a goal from Sydney Lokale. In that same year Sharks produced the league's Most Valuable Player in Erick Kapaito. The striker won the League Top Scorer and the New Player of the year and was also 2nd in the league Fair Play award of the season as he was never booked the entire season. The team finished 6th in the league.\r\n\r\nIn the 2018\/19 season the team played in the CAF Confederation Cup Qualifiers for the very 1st time. The team beat Djibouti's Arta Solar FC in the 1st round before being eliminated by Ghana's Asante Kotoko in the second round. The team got to the Cup final for the 3rd season in a row but this time lost 3-1 to Bandari FC and finished the league on position 8.\r\n\r\nThe team trains at Utalii College where the management has signed a memorandum of understanding with the school to allow them to use the grounds while upgrading the facilities.",

The club was formed and owned by World Hope International, a charitable organization.\r\n\r\nAfter one season in the Nationwide League, World Hope was promoted to the Kenyan Premier League.\r\n\r\nIn October 2008, the club was bought by Ambassadors in Sport (AIS Kenya), who renamed the club to Nairobi City Stars FC after the 2008 season.\r\n\r\nAfter the take over Nairobi City Stars was initially coached by German manager Oliver Page, a former Bundesliga player. He resigned from the post-half-season in June 2009 despite good results, citing personal issues\r\n\r\nAfter a short while under the new owners, the team reverted to Peter Jabuya who would struggle with the team till March 2019 when the club was fully acquired by Jonathan Jackson Foundation, a community focused setup named after its founder Jonathan Jackson who is a real estate mogul in Kenya and in Europe.\r\n\r\nUpon the change of hands the new owners roped in online journalist Patrick Korir as the CEO to streamline the clubs operations. And in July 2019 the club went searching for a foreign Coach and hired Sarajevo-born Sanjin Alagic, a UEFA Pro licensed coach from Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\n\r\nHe led the team to the 2020\/21 Kenyan National Super League title and automatic promotion back to the Kenyan Premier League    after four seasons out.",
