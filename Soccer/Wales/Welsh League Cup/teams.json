            "strDescriptionEN": "Afan Lido Football Club (Welsh: Clwb Pêl-droed Lido Afan) is a football team based in Port Talbot, Wales, playing in the Cymru South.\r\n\r\nAfan Lido F.C. were founded in 1967 shortly after the opening of the Afan Lido Sports Centre in Aberavon. A football team was set up to give the Centre's users a proper organisation. Ken Williams was the prime mover behind the club.\r\n\r\nLido gained admission to the Port Talbot and District League for the 1967\/68 season. In 1971–72 the club was accepted into the Welsh Football League, and two years later was promoted into the First Division (now the Second Division), and another two years later they were promoted again into the Premier Division (now the First Division). After a barren spell they were relegated but were promoted in 1984–85; by this time the League had been reorganised and a higher National Division had been formed, to which Afan Lido were promoted in 1989–90 after finishing 3rd (they had actually won the Premier Division the two previous seasons, but not been promoted because of the ground criteria set by the League).\r\n\r\nAfan Lido became founder members of the League of Wales in 1992, and won the League Cup in 1992–93 and 1993–94. The next year the porous defence was addressed, and the team finished in second place in the League, winning a UEFA Cup place, but they were defeated by RAF Yelgava of Latvia on the away-goals rule. This was a taste of things to come, and Afan Lido were relegated from the League of Wales before winning their place back after an absence of two years.\r\n\r\nLido's young team that emerged during the spell out of the League of Wales grew together and the club enjoyed several encouraging seasons after settling again in the top flight. Lido's policy of choosing players from within the club's huge junior structure (which has 25 teams for all age groups, from under 5s upwards) paid off, when they finished 5th place in 2001–02. If the club had scored a single point more, in fact, Lido would have taken the town into European football for a second time.\r\n\r\nLeaner years followed that near miss, and in 2005 the club left the Welsh Premier in controversial circumstances, after being deducted points for fielding an ineligible player in a league game. The points deducted sunk the Lido into the relegation zone below NEWI Cefn Druids, which sealed their fate.\r\n\r\nIn 2011 Lido secured a return to the Welsh Premier and their first season in the top flight saw the club survive the drop. The club also won the Welsh Premier League Cup, defeating Newtown on penalties at Aberystwyth.\r\n\r\nOff-field issues surfaced the following season, however, and Lido had to assemble an all-new squad under the guidance of Paul Reid. The club finished bottom of the Welsh Premier, but survived relegation due to the demise of Llanelli and the inability of Haverfordwest County to finish in a promotion spot in Welsh League Division One.\r\n\r\nOn 4 July 2013 Afan Lido appointed former club captain and fans favourite Paul Evans to the hotseat as they look to cement their position within the top division.\r\n\r\nFor the 2016–17 season, the club found themselves in the same division as town rivals Port Talbot.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Buckley Town Football Club is a Welsh football team based in Buckley, Flintshire, Wales and playing in the JD Cymru North.\r\n\r\nBuckley is regarded as an established football centre in North Wales with the game was first introduced in the area around 1860. With the new ball, they regarded themselves as a real team, and established themselves as a football club, playing under the name of Belmont Swifts Football Club. This formed the basis of what would later become Buckley Victoria Football Club, the first organised team in the town. The team had their own pitch at Mill Lane, and soon played home and away matches against teams such as Mold Athletic, Wrexham Victoria and Rhyl Athletic.\r\n\r\nBuckley Victoria were superseded by the Buckley Engineers, who carried on the 'Vics' winning ways. The amateurs' most famous team consisted of ten colliers, and a plumber. They picked up a huge amount of silverware in their playing days, including the Welsh Amateur Cup which they won on three occasions. In 1887 Buckley Town football club was formed, and it wasn't long before they had a taste of success. They went on to win the Wirral & District League in 1898, and picked up the Pike Challenge Cup in the same year. Buckley Town continued to play right up to the 1920s, and in 1925 joined the Welsh League, North Division. In 1937 they went on to win the North Wales amateur cup.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1930s it seemed that Buckley Town Football Club and other organised football teams in Buckley fell apart and no longer continued to be successful in competitions. Then, in 1937 Buckley Town A.F.C won the North Wales Amateur Cup. In 1949 Buckley Wanderers and Buckley Rovers were the only two teams playing competitive football in Buckley. Buckley Rovers struggled in the lower division of the Welsh Leagues, while Buckley Wanderers joined the Welsh National League Division One. In their first season, Buckley Wanderers finished runners-up behind Chirk AAA, and again in the 1953–54 season finished runners-up to Overton St Mary's. Then in the 1955–56 season Buckley Wanderers scored over one hundred goals to clinch the League title.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1960–61 season Buckley Rovers joined Buckley Wanderers in the Welsh Football League First Division. With two teams firmly established in top-flight Welsh football, Buckley once again was revelling in the 'glory days'. Buckley Wanderers finished runners-up for the third time in their history, with Chirk AAA finishing just two points ahead of them. Rovers struggled in their first season in top-flight football, finishing ninth in the league. Then in the 1963–64 season Buckley Rovers were relegated, only to come straight back up the following season.\r\n\r\nFrom 1974 Buckley Rovers then became the better of the two sides, with a runners-up finish and a third-place finish. The 1976–77 season saw both teams finish in the bottom half of the table. This was the end of both teams, and in 1977 an agreement was made for both teams to join and play under the name of Buckley Town Football Club, which is the club known to this day.\r\n\r\nSince the millennium, the club has had its most successful period to date. It has won the NEW Challenge Cup six times, the Cymru Alliance League Cup once in 2003–04 and in the League the club finished 3rd in 2002–03, 2nd in 2003–04, finally becoming Champions in 2004–05. In 2009–10 Buckley Town returned to the Racecourse to win the NEW Challenge Cup and were 4th in the Cymru Alliance League.\r\n\r\nWelsh National League Presidents Cup Winners 2018\r\nWelsh National League Presidents Cup Winners 2018\r\nFrom the phoenix of the previous season the club became 2017–18 Welsh National League (Wrexham Area) league champions, claiming their spot in the 2018–19 Cymru Alliance. The honour was achieved with thanks to Dan Moore as manager and the crop of local talent sourced from Buckley, local villages and towns within a 5-mile radius of the club.",

The club is nicknamed \"the Canaries\" because of its yellow and green strip, a nickname that dates from 1895. Caernarfon Town plays at The Oval. \r\nThe first football club in Caernarfon, known as Caernarvon Wanderers, was formed in September 1876 and played at various grounds before moving to the Oval in 1888. On 30 October 1886, Wanderers were the first team from north west Wales to enter the FA Cup and lost 10–1 away to Stoke. Five years later, however, that particular club went out of existence but, in 1894, several former players began a new team called Carnarvon Ironopolis. That club competed in the North Wales Coast League, winning the championship on two occasions and reaching the semi-final of the Welsh Cup in 1900 and again in 1902. Unfortunately, following a dispute with the league, Ironopolis folded in 1903. The demise of the club resulted in some of the players forming the Caernarvon Celts while others affiliated to the Caernarvon RWF (Royal Welsh Fusiliers), both clubs playing at the Oval.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Conwy Borough Football Club (Welsh: Clwb Pêl-droed Bwrdeistref Conwy) are a Welsh football club based in Conwy, playing in the Ardal NW which is at tier three of the Welsh football pyramid. Between 1977 and June 2012 they were known as Conwy United. \r\n\r\nFollowing the demise of Borough United in 1967, Welsh representatives in the European Cup Winners’ Cup in 1963\/64, there was a void of Welsh League clubs in the Conwy area. Historically there has always been football in the area, and especially a Conwy team, stretching back to the 1870s. Then in 1977 Conwy Town and Conwy Royal British Legion, both of whom played in the Vale of Conwy League, amalgamated to form Conwy United.\r\n\r\nThe club was duly elected to the Welsh League (North) that later became the Welsh Alliance League. In 1981\/82 the club won the Welsh Intermediate Cup (now called the FAW Welsh Trophy) and the club also won the Welsh Alliance League title in 1984\/85 and 1985\/86. In 1990 the club became founder members of the Cymru Alliance League and finished in the top seven both seasons that they were members.\r\n\r\nThen in 1992 the club became founder members of the League of Wales. The club finished a creditable 7th place in its first season and in 1995\/96 finished in 3rd place under the guidance of John Hulse, with Kenny McKenna setting a club scoring record of 49 goals in a season. The club qualified for the 1996 UEFA Intertoto Cup and played Charleroi (Belgium) and SV Ried (Austria) at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham, and travelled to Zaglebie Lubin (Poland) and Silkeborg (Denmark). Despite not progressing past the group stage, the club gave a good account of itself especially with a 0–0 draw against Charleroi and losing to a late goal against SV Ried.\r\n\r\nIn the following three seasons the club reached the semi-finals of the Welsh Cup twice, and also qualified for the FAW Premier Cup twice, most notably holding Swansea City to 0–0 draw at the Vetch Field. However the financial burden had begun to take its toll on the club and in 2000 were relegated.\r\n\r\nThe club decided not to progress to the Cymru Alliance for financial reasons and instead accepted an invitation to join the Welsh Alliance League. In its second season the club was League runners-up and Cookson Cup runners-up. The following two seasons were very difficult both on and off the field but the return of Nigel Roberts as manager kept the club up and the 2004–05 season started tremendously well with the club sitting at the top of the League. However, tragedy struck when Nigel Roberts was killed in a road accident. The league slipped just out of reach but under the guidance of Danny McGoona reached the final of the Cookson Cup again, only to lose out 4–3 to Bethesda in one of the most dramatic finals for years.\r\n\r\nIn the 2009\/10 season under the management of Barry Jones and Keith Tansley a young Conwy side finally clinched the Cookson Cup. An extra time penalty from Matty Bennett won the trophy against rivals Llandudno Junction at Maesdu. In the league the club finished sixth.\r\n\r\nThe following season Paul Moroney took over as Manager with Barry Jones and Keith Tansley remaining at the club. The 2010–11 turned out to be one of the most successful seasons of the clubs recent history. Although losing the first game of the season away at Denbigh, Moroney's side went on to win the Welsh Alliance Division One and gain promotion to the Huws Gray Cymru Alliance. Conwy also reached the final of the FAW Trophy (held at Belle Vue)) where they led by two goals to nil until the 91st minute and somehow conceded three goals in as many minutes to gift Holywell Town the Trophy in one of the most dramatic finals in years. Conwy United also won the Fairplay League and young star Toby Jones picked up the top goalscorer award with a forty plus tally in all competitions which earned the youngster a move to full-time at Neath.\r\n\r\nIn the 2011\/12 season, Conwy got off to a flying start in the 2nd tier of Welsh football winning their first four games under new management Steve Jones and Dean Martin. However, form dropped dramatically and in December the duo left the club. former chairman Geoff Cartwright appointed Mick McGrath as manager who signed a number of key players the team needed including Dean Canning, John Owen and Eddie Jebb (on-loan from Bangor City). The club went on to finish 10th.\r\n\r\nIn April 2012 the Football Association of Wales domestic committee approved a name change request that from the 2012\/13 season the club was to be renamed Conwy Borough F.C\r\n\r\nThe club appointed Chris Herbert as the new first team manager in May 2012. The new manager re-structured the Y Morfa outfit in to a top 3 team which also lifted the league cup, when they beat Caersws on penalties in the final, with goalkeeper Terry McCormick saving 2 penalties, which was the Tangerines' 5th penalty shoot out win in cup competitions that season.\r\n\r\nChris Herbert and John Keegan left their posts in December 2013 and were replaced by players Darren Moss and Aden Shannon until the end of the season who guided the side to a second-placed finish. Moss was to remain in charge for the 2013\/14 season but after a disappointing start was then was released by the club in November 2014 with Shannon taking temporary charge and overseeing an 11th-placed finish. Shannon was placed in permanent charge of the Tangerines for the 2015\/16 season but history was to repeat itself when, after a poor start and with the club languishing in the relegation zone, was relieved of his duties and was eventually replaced by Jason Aldcroft and former TNS defender Tommy Holmes. Aldcroft oversaw wholesale changes to the squad and steered the club to safety with an eventual 11th-placed finish.\r\n\r\nOff the field, the club has made giant strides in improving the stadium and its facilities and opened its new clubhouse building \"Y Morfa Venue\" in the summer of 2014. With a recent upgrade to the floodlights the club has moved a step closer to achieving a domestic club licence. With a thriving junior section a youth Academy has also been established and expanded as the club looks to develop more local talent in the future.\r\n\r\nIn the close of the 2015\/16 season Geoff Cartwright (chair) & Darren cartwright (Vice Chair) resignations due to personal commitments were accepted by the board of directors along with the appointment of Gareth Thomas As first team manager & assistant Alun Winstanley.\r\n\r\nAugust 2017 seen the introduction of new directors to the Executive board – successful local Businessman Luke Blundell, Solicitor Chris Wilton & existing Committee member Craig Crossfield.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Llanidloes Town Football Club (Welsh: Clwb Pêl-droed Tref Llanidloes) are an association football club based in the town of Llanidloes, Wales. They currently play in the Cymru North.\r\n\r\nThe first ever recorded game of football in mid Wales was in Llanidloes at the 'Lower Green' on Victoria Avenue on 26 December 1870. The club was founded 5 years later in 1875, the same year as 'A' Newtown team. The club are recorded as playing a fixture against Newtown on Christmas Day 1875 on a field called Caegwyn. 'Records of Llanidloes' early days are quite patchy, but it is known that the club reached the semi-final of the Welsh Cup in 1881, losing to Newtown.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the 1906\/07 season, Llanidloes embarked on league football and joined the Montgomeryshire and District League. Success quickly followed and the club took the league championship six times during the eight years the competition was in being prior to 1920. The 1920s and 1930s were the most successful decades in the club's history. The Mid Wales League title was won on seven occasions and the club reached five Welsh Amateur Cup finals, winning the trophy in 1922. In addition, Llanidloes won the Montgomeryshire Challenge Cup thirteen times, including eight successive wins between 1928 and 1935.\r\n\r\nFollowing the war, Llanidloes won the Mid Wales League in 1946\/47 and, in 1950\/51, became the first champions of the Welsh National League (Mid Wales) completing a ‘double’ by lifting the League Cup. The 1950s and 1960s saw “The Daffs” win the League Cup again (in 1954, 1959 and 1962), whilst the highlight of those post-war years was the winning of the Welsh Amateur Cup in 1965. Further league championships followed in 1972 and 1974 before, in 1980\/81, the club emulated the feat of thirty years earlier when completing another league and cup ‘double’. Llanidloes Town's most recent major success was winning the Central Wales FA Cup in 1984. In 1990, the club became founder members of the Cymru Alliance and, despite two disappointing seasons in the new competition, were delighted to accept the invitation to join the League of Wales for its inaugural season in 1992\/93.\r\n\r\nWhen the newly formed League of Wales was launched in 1992 Llanidloes Town were founder members but lasted only one season before dropping into the Cymru Alliance having been promised by the FAW that there were to be no relegations that season, a drop which proved to be costly. Five years were spent in the Cymru Alliance before another drop, this time to the mid Wales League in 1999. Nine years later another relegation – this time to the Montgomershire  League saw the club playing at its lowest ever level.\r\n\r\nThe fightback at that level began at the end of the 2009–10 season with the Montgomeryshire League championship and a return to the mid Wales League. After a period of consolidation Llanidloes Town won the Spar Mid Wales League at the end of the 2012–13 season with 132 goals scored in the process. To cap it off, The Daffs also won the league cup that season. Two seasons in the Cymru Alliance followed but another relegation, by just one point, saw them move back to the mid Wales league.\r\n\r\nThe club were Division 1 champions in 2019-20, and were therefore promoted to the Cymru North.",

They currently play in the Cymru South, after two consecutive promotions as champions.\r\n\r\nLlantwit Major Football Club was formed in 1962. A selection committee selected the team until entry to the South Wales Amateur League Second Division was gained in 1971. Life Member Gwyn John was appointed as the first team manager. Manager John's team were promoted to the 1st Division after finishing second in the 1976–77 season. Llantwit consolidated in the division before claiming their first Amateur League title under new manager Alan Foster in the 1979–80 season. This was closely followed by their second championship just a year later after retaining the title and adding the Corinthian Cup to achieve the double. This kick started a golden period in the 80's where the club won another double of league and Corinthian Cup in 1983–84. The hat-trick of Corinthian Cups came in the 1986–87 season. The club were also runners up in the league on a further two occasions during the decade. The 1990s by contrast was a very mixed period for the club, first relegation in 1991–92 under Rob Sherman's leadership, followed by promotion two years later with Steve Manning at the helm. Fast forward two years and relegation, this time with record appearance holder Pete Lingham as player\/manager. However the club made sure they were in the first division again at the turn of the millennium, the management duo of Kev Pycroft and Phil Clay gaining promotion by winning a comfortable Second Division title. The club spent the next decade consistently flirting with the league title without ever looking like serious title contenders with Llantwit stalwarts Tim Watts and John Guy providing much needed stability in charge. The club also came runners up in the Corinthian Cup in 2005. John Guy stepped down as manager in 2010 following a decade as manager to move upstairs as Chairman. Guy did this selflessly in order to allow the introduction of fresh ideas into the club from new boss Kevin Rees in partnership with Watts. Rees and Watts introduced flesh blood into the playing staff gaining instant success by lifting the SWFA Senior Cup in 2010–11. The bedrock of the new players was Darren Robinson who became player\/coach\/manager along with the irrepressible Watts.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "The New Saints of Oswestry Town & Llansantffraid Football Club also known as the New Saints or TNS is a full-time-professional Welsh football club representing Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain in Powys, Wales and Oswestry in Shropshire.– the two places are 8 miles (13 km) apart. They play in the Welsh Premier League, which they have won a record eleven times – including the past six seasons.\r\nFounded in 1959 as Llansantffraid F.C., from 1997 to 2006, the club was known as Total Network Solutions F.C. after its sponsor. In 2003, it merged with Oswestry Town F.C. and three years later it adopted its current name.\r\nTNS play at Park Hall in Oswestry after moving there in 2007 from the Recreation Ground in Llansantffraid. Park Hall accommodates 2034 of which 1,000 are seated spectators and there are plans to upgrade the ground to 3,000 capacity in the future.\r\nThe club was formed as Llansantffraid F.C. to represent the tiny border village of Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain (population: 1,000) in 1959, and played at the Recreation Ground.\r\nThey first tasted competitive football in the Montgomeryshire Amateur Football League (then the fourth level of the Welsh football league system), winning the championship seven times. At the end of the 1989–90 season they were elected to the Central Wales League (now the Mid-Wales League) but their stay was brief, winning promotion to the Cymru Alliance as runners-up on their first attempt. Llansantffraid's meteoric rise continued and in 1992–93 they gained promotion to the League of Wales, now the Welsh Premier League, as champions and won the Welsh Intermediate Cup (formerly the Welsh Amateur Cup).",
