            "strDescriptionEN": "Afan Lido Football Club (Welsh: Clwb Pêl-droed Lido Afan) is a football team based in Port Talbot, Wales, playing in the Cymru South.\r\n\r\nAfan Lido F.C. were founded in 1967 shortly after the opening of the Afan Lido Sports Centre in Aberavon. A football team was set up to give the Centre's users a proper organisation. Ken Williams was the prime mover behind the club.\r\n\r\nLido gained admission to the Port Talbot and District League for the 1967\/68 season. In 1971–72 the club was accepted into the Welsh Football League, and two years later was promoted into the First Division (now the Second Division), and another two years later they were promoted again into the Premier Division (now the First Division). After a barren spell they were relegated but were promoted in 1984–85; by this time the League had been reorganised and a higher National Division had been formed, to which Afan Lido were promoted in 1989–90 after finishing 3rd (they had actually won the Premier Division the two previous seasons, but not been promoted because of the ground criteria set by the League).\r\n\r\nAfan Lido became founder members of the League of Wales in 1992, and won the League Cup in 1992–93 and 1993–94. The next year the porous defence was addressed, and the team finished in second place in the League, winning a UEFA Cup place, but they were defeated by RAF Yelgava of Latvia on the away-goals rule. This was a taste of things to come, and Afan Lido were relegated from the League of Wales before winning their place back after an absence of two years.\r\n\r\nLido's young team that emerged during the spell out of the League of Wales grew together and the club enjoyed several encouraging seasons after settling again in the top flight. Lido's policy of choosing players from within the club's huge junior structure (which has 25 teams for all age groups, from under 5s upwards) paid off, when they finished 5th place in 2001–02. If the club had scored a single point more, in fact, Lido would have taken the town into European football for a second time.\r\n\r\nLeaner years followed that near miss, and in 2005 the club left the Welsh Premier in controversial circumstances, after being deducted points for fielding an ineligible player in a league game. The points deducted sunk the Lido into the relegation zone below NEWI Cefn Druids, which sealed their fate.\r\n\r\nIn 2011 Lido secured a return to the Welsh Premier and their first season in the top flight saw the club survive the drop. The club also won the Welsh Premier League Cup, defeating Newtown on penalties at Aberystwyth.\r\n\r\nOff-field issues surfaced the following season, however, and Lido had to assemble an all-new squad under the guidance of Paul Reid. The club finished bottom of the Welsh Premier, but survived relegation due to the demise of Llanelli and the inability of Haverfordwest County to finish in a promotion spot in Welsh League Division One.\r\n\r\nOn 4 July 2013 Afan Lido appointed former club captain and fans favourite Paul Evans to the hotseat as they look to cement their position within the top division.\r\n\r\nFor the 2016–17 season, the club found themselves in the same division as town rivals Port Talbot.",

The Airfield features three unusual retracting floodlights as it is adjacent to an operational runway. In 2014, the grass surface was replaced with a 3G synthetic pitch which is also available for hire.\r\nIn the 2022–23 season, the club finished with -4 points after being deducted 6 points and losing all but two matches. As a result, they were relegated back to the Cymru North after having been promoted in the 2021–22 season.",

They stated, “We want fans to reconnect with each other and restore the pride and feeling of being a supporter of our historic club. The new club is a creative and positive solution for an ever-changing and precarious situation. We are not disowning Bangor City FC or its history, the club is OURS, it belongs to the fans and local community. “Owners” will come and go but the people remain. Keep the faith.”\r\nAn application was submitted to the Football Association of Wales to enter the new club in the Welsh football league system, and a Supporters' trust set up. A women's team, Bangor 1876 Women's FC, was also formed.

            "strDescriptionEN": "Buckley Town Football Club is a Welsh football team based in Buckley, Flintshire, Wales and playing in the JD Cymru North.\r\n\r\nBuckley is regarded as an established football centre in North Wales with the game was first introduced in the area around 1860. With the new ball, they regarded themselves as a real team, and established themselves as a football club, playing under the name of Belmont Swifts Football Club. This formed the basis of what would later become Buckley Victoria Football Club, the first organised team in the town. The team had their own pitch at Mill Lane, and soon played home and away matches against teams such as Mold Athletic, Wrexham Victoria and Rhyl Athletic.\r\n\r\nBuckley Victoria were superseded by the Buckley Engineers, who carried on the 'Vics' winning ways. The amateurs' most famous team consisted of ten colliers, and a plumber. They picked up a huge amount of silverware in their playing days, including the Welsh Amateur Cup which they won on three occasions. In 1887 Buckley Town football club was formed, and it wasn't long before they had a taste of success. They went on to win the Wirral & District League in 1898, and picked up the Pike Challenge Cup in the same year. Buckley Town continued to play right up to the 1920s, and in 1925 joined the Welsh League, North Division. In 1937 they went on to win the North Wales amateur cup.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1930s it seemed that Buckley Town Football Club and other organised football teams in Buckley fell apart and no longer continued to be successful in competitions. Then, in 1937 Buckley Town A.F.C won the North Wales Amateur Cup. In 1949 Buckley Wanderers and Buckley Rovers were the only two teams playing competitive football in Buckley. Buckley Rovers struggled in the lower division of the Welsh Leagues, while Buckley Wanderers joined the Welsh National League Division One. In their first season, Buckley Wanderers finished runners-up behind Chirk AAA, and again in the 1953–54 season finished runners-up to Overton St Mary's. Then in the 1955–56 season Buckley Wanderers scored over one hundred goals to clinch the League title.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1960–61 season Buckley Rovers joined Buckley Wanderers in the Welsh Football League First Division. With two teams firmly established in top-flight Welsh football, Buckley once again was revelling in the 'glory days'. Buckley Wanderers finished runners-up for the third time in their history, with Chirk AAA finishing just two points ahead of them. Rovers struggled in their first season in top-flight football, finishing ninth in the league. Then in the 1963–64 season Buckley Rovers were relegated, only to come straight back up the following season.\r\n\r\nFrom 1974 Buckley Rovers then became the better of the two sides, with a runners-up finish and a third-place finish. The 1976–77 season saw both teams finish in the bottom half of the table. This was the end of both teams, and in 1977 an agreement was made for both teams to join and play under the name of Buckley Town Football Club, which is the club known to this day.\r\n\r\nSince the millennium, the club has had its most successful period to date. It has won the NEW Challenge Cup six times, the Cymru Alliance League Cup once in 2003–04 and in the League the club finished 3rd in 2002–03, 2nd in 2003–04, finally becoming Champions in 2004–05. In 2009–10 Buckley Town returned to the Racecourse to win the NEW Challenge Cup and were 4th in the Cymru Alliance League.\r\n\r\nWelsh National League Presidents Cup Winners 2018\r\nWelsh National League Presidents Cup Winners 2018\r\nFrom the phoenix of the previous season the club became 2017–18 Welsh National League (Wrexham Area) league champions, claiming their spot in the 2018–19 Cymru Alliance. The honour was achieved with thanks to Dan Moore as manager and the crop of local talent sourced from Buckley, local villages and towns within a 5-mile radius of the club.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "\"Caerau (Ely) Association Football Club is a Welsh team based in Cardiff. It was formed in 1955. The club plays in the Cymru South, which is second tier of the Welsh football pyramid.\r\n\r\nCaerau Ely were formed in 1955 joining the junior division of the Cardiff Combination League. A set of red jerseys given to the club by Mr.Ron Miller of Cross Bros. AFC was to determine the colours of the club forever. The club started its playing days on the Ely Racecourse moving on to Glyn Derw School in the eighties and then finally moving onto the Cwrt-yr-Ala ground in Ely.\r\n\r\nIn 1991 they gained entry to the new Senior League and then progressed to the CC Sports Welsh League in 1998 after beating Dinas Powys 1-0 in the play-off held at Bridgend.\r\n\r\nThe history shows that after winning well over eighty combined league titles and cups in its time, Caerau Ely has become one of the most successful clubs in Cardiff.\r\n\r\nSeason 04\/05 the club gained promotion from the 3rd Division to the 2nd finishing in the third place, they carried on surviving near the bottom and scraping to safety at the end of most seasons, with most players leaving their best days behind them, the club realised they had to look at the future.\r\n\r\nSeason 06\/07 saw the coming together of Caerau Ely and the youth of Llanishen Dons football club. Caerau without a representative side in the youth league approached Llanishen to invite them to join the Caerau set up. The advantages for Llanishen were obvious in that they could play at a very good level and the advantages for Caerau were that they would have a new group of young players for the future.\r\n\r\nThe first season saw the youngsters finish third in the East division and also saw a number of players move up and take their place in the senior side, the next season they finished second with even more of a presence in the first side.\r\n\r\nSeason 09\/10 was the biggest in the club's history ending in promotion to Division One, winning 8 drawing 2 and with 1 loss in the last 11 games they took third place. On times the club played with a starting eleven that did not have a player over the age of 21, so the youth policy adopted in 06\/07 had finally paid off.\r\n\r\nThe first Season in Division One went very well, with the club finishing with a respectful fifth place, which was the club's highest finish in their history and a great achievement. The second season the club came up very short, with major problems trying to keep hold of players and discipline on and off the pitch returning to days the club thought they had moved on from. They finished bottom of the league.\r\n\r\nCaerau Ely started the 2012–13 season back in Division Two after a short but eye opening period in the first division. The club employed a new team Manager in Nana Baah, who was helped by Giles Smith and Dominic Broad to try and rebuild the team.\r\n\r\nIn their first season in charge, they managed to work wonders and gain promotion back into Division One and in the process creating a new professional approach at the club. Discipline at the club was of a very good standard and major improvements have been made under the management of Nana Baah.\r\n\r\nIn 2014–15 Caerau won the Welsh League Division One title and were runners up in the league cup losing to Taff's Well A.F.C. at Jenner Park. \"",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Llanidloes Town Football Club (Welsh: Clwb Pêl-droed Tref Llanidloes) are an association football club based in the town of Llanidloes, Wales. They currently play in the Cymru North.\r\n\r\nThe first ever recorded game of football in mid Wales was in Llanidloes at the 'Lower Green' on Victoria Avenue on 26 December 1870. The club was founded 5 years later in 1875, the same year as 'A' Newtown team. The club are recorded as playing a fixture against Newtown on Christmas Day 1875 on a field called Caegwyn. 'Records of Llanidloes' early days are quite patchy, but it is known that the club reached the semi-final of the Welsh Cup in 1881, losing to Newtown.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the 1906\/07 season, Llanidloes embarked on league football and joined the Montgomeryshire and District League. Success quickly followed and the club took the league championship six times during the eight years the competition was in being prior to 1920. The 1920s and 1930s were the most successful decades in the club's history. The Mid Wales League title was won on seven occasions and the club reached five Welsh Amateur Cup finals, winning the trophy in 1922. In addition, Llanidloes won the Montgomeryshire Challenge Cup thirteen times, including eight successive wins between 1928 and 1935.\r\n\r\nFollowing the war, Llanidloes won the Mid Wales League in 1946\/47 and, in 1950\/51, became the first champions of the Welsh National League (Mid Wales) completing a ‘double’ by lifting the League Cup. The 1950s and 1960s saw “The Daffs” win the League Cup again (in 1954, 1959 and 1962), whilst the highlight of those post-war years was the winning of the Welsh Amateur Cup in 1965. Further league championships followed in 1972 and 1974 before, in 1980\/81, the club emulated the feat of thirty years earlier when completing another league and cup ‘double’. Llanidloes Town's most recent major success was winning the Central Wales FA Cup in 1984. In 1990, the club became founder members of the Cymru Alliance and, despite two disappointing seasons in the new competition, were delighted to accept the invitation to join the League of Wales for its inaugural season in 1992\/93.\r\n\r\nWhen the newly formed League of Wales was launched in 1992 Llanidloes Town were founder members but lasted only one season before dropping into the Cymru Alliance having been promised by the FAW that there were to be no relegations that season, a drop which proved to be costly. Five years were spent in the Cymru Alliance before another drop, this time to the mid Wales League in 1999. Nine years later another relegation – this time to the Montgomershire  League saw the club playing at its lowest ever level.\r\n\r\nThe fightback at that level began at the end of the 2009–10 season with the Montgomeryshire League championship and a return to the mid Wales League. After a period of consolidation Llanidloes Town won the Spar Mid Wales League at the end of the 2012–13 season with 132 goals scored in the process. To cap it off, The Daffs also won the league cup that season. Two seasons in the Cymru Alliance followed but another relegation, by just one point, saw them move back to the mid Wales league.\r\n\r\nThe club were Division 1 champions in 2019-20, and were therefore promoted to the Cymru North.",

They currently play in the Cymru South, after two consecutive promotions as champions.\r\n\r\nLlantwit Major Football Club was formed in 1962. A selection committee selected the team until entry to the South Wales Amateur League Second Division was gained in 1971. Life Member Gwyn John was appointed as the first team manager. Manager John's team were promoted to the 1st Division after finishing second in the 1976–77 season. Llantwit consolidated in the division before claiming their first Amateur League title under new manager Alan Foster in the 1979–80 season. This was closely followed by their second championship just a year later after retaining the title and adding the Corinthian Cup to achieve the double. This kick started a golden period in the 80's where the club won another double of league and Corinthian Cup in 1983–84. The hat-trick of Corinthian Cups came in the 1986–87 season. The club were also runners up in the league on a further two occasions during the decade. The 1990s by contrast was a very mixed period for the club, first relegation in 1991–92 under Rob Sherman's leadership, followed by promotion two years later with Steve Manning at the helm. Fast forward two years and relegation, this time with record appearance holder Pete Lingham as player\/manager. However the club made sure they were in the first division again at the turn of the millennium, the management duo of Kev Pycroft and Phil Clay gaining promotion by winning a comfortable Second Division title. The club spent the next decade consistently flirting with the league title without ever looking like serious title contenders with Llantwit stalwarts Tim Watts and John Guy providing much needed stability in charge. The club also came runners up in the Corinthian Cup in 2005. John Guy stepped down as manager in 2010 following a decade as manager to move upstairs as Chairman. Guy did this selflessly in order to allow the introduction of fresh ideas into the club from new boss Kevin Rees in partnership with Watts. Rees and Watts introduced flesh blood into the playing staff gaining instant success by lifting the SWFA Senior Cup in 2010–11. The bedrock of the new players was Darren Robinson who became player\/coach\/manager along with the irrepressible Watts.",

Depending on sponsorship, the club was renamed Flexsys Cefn Druids F.C. in 1998, and NEWI Cefn Druids F.C. in 2003 (after sponsorship by the North East Wales Institute of Higher Education), and plays at Plaskynaston Lane in Cefn Mawr. The club was renamed again following in the summer of 2009 to Elements Cefn Druids F.C. The club reverted to Cefn Druids A.F.C. in 2010 following the end of the sponsorship deal.\r\nThe team take their prolific history from the famous old Welsh team Druids FC who were founded in the early 1860s. They had won the Welsh Cup on no less than 8 occasions and have finished runners-up five times but fell on hard times with the advent of professional football. Druids can claim to originate from the oldest existing team located in Wales, thus making it also the oldest football club in the world outside England. This is reflected in club's nickname, 'The Ancients'. However, Oswestry Town does predate Druids but is geographically in England, though the team has always participated in the Welsh system and were early members of the Welsh FA, and would thus consider themselves a Welsh side \r\n   In 1992 after many years of discussion the inevitable amalgamation of Druids United and Cefn Albion F.C. took place to end the internal village soccer rivalry in the village of Cefn Mawr. The new look club took the bold step of applying to join the new Cymru Alliance. The joint resources of the clubs could be focused on a revival of football fortunes in the village of Cefn Mawr.\r\nDruids (c.1869–1923)\/ Druids United (1923–1992)\/ Cefn Druids A.F.C.

In 2000, Trefelin BGC won the FAW Trophy by winning in the final 6–2 against Bryntirion Athletic F.C.. In 2007 they were promoted as champions of the South Wales Amateur League Second Division and following their first season in the First Division, Trefelin BGC finished the season as runners-up to eventual champions and former Welsh League team AFC Porth. In 2014, Trefelin BGC won promotion from the South Wales Amateur League First Division with at least a fourteen-game unbeaten run. In the same year, they won the W John Owen Cup by defeating AFC Bargoed. In the 2015–16 season, Trefelin won promotion to the Welsh Football League after winning the newly formed South Wales Alliance League.\r\n\r\nOn 2 January 2019 the club announced the signing of former Swansea City striker Lee Trundle.\r\n\r\nThe club were champions of the Welsh Football League Division One at the end of the 2019–20 season, remaining unbeaten in the league during a season curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
