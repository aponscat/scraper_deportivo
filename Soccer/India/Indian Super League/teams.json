The club competes in the Indian Super League, the top flight of Indian football, as well as the Calcutta Premier Division A, the top tier state football league of West Bengal.\r\n\r\nFounded in August 1920, the club became affiliated with the Indian Football Association (IFA) in 1922 before earning promotion to the Calcutta Football League first division in 1924. East Bengal won their first league title in 1942 and have since gone on to win the title a record 39 times. The club was also a founding member of the National Football League in 1996 and have won the league title three times. They have also won eight Federation Cups, three Super Cups, a record 29 IFA Shield titles, and a record 16 Durand Cup titles, making the club one of the most decorated in Indian football.\r\n\r\nThe club is supported mainly by the immigrant population (known as Bangal), who were forced to leave their homes during the partition of 1947. For those people, the East Bengal club became a source of identity and hope. The huge influx of dispossessed led to a socio-economic crisis in the state. This led to rivalries in jobs, business, schools and even on football pitches among the immigrants and native population of West Bengal. East Bengal has a long-standing rivalry with its cross-town competitors Mohun Bagan, which is mainly supported by the native population, with whom it competes in the Kolkata derby, Asia's biggest football rivalry. East Bengal also shares a rivalry with another Kolkata club, Mohammedan. The club wears red and gold, which gives them the nickname Red and Gold Brigade.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Mohammedan Sporting Club is an Indian professional sports club based in Kolkata, West Bengal. They are best known for their professional men's association football team, which competes in the Indian Super League, the top of the Indian football league system, as well as Calcutta Football League (CFL), the oldest football league in Asia. Formed in February 1891, it is one of the oldest active football clubs in the country.\r\n\r\nThe club became affiliated with the Indian Football Association (IFA) to play in the second division of CFL before earning promotion to the premier division of CFL in 1933 and a year later, Mohammedan became the first Indian team to win the league and in 1938 became the first team to win it five consecutive times. After the independence of India, Mohammedan became the first Indian club to win a football tournament on foreign soil by lifting the Aga Khan Gold Cup in 1960. In 1996, the club was one of the founding members of India's first nationwide league – National Football League (NFL). For all its laurels, Mohammedan has never won a top-tier league, only managing to win the 2004–05 NFL Second Division to qualify for NFL, and the 2020 I-League qualifiers to qualify for I-League, which was then the first-tier league of India. They have won the Federation Cup twice in 1983–84 and 1984–85.\r\n\r\nFounded during the early years of India's independence movement, Mohammedan had been a symbol of progressive Muslim identity through the tumultuous period of freedom struggle in colonial India and the subsequent struggle for status in an altered post-partition landscape. Therefore, the club is primarily supported by the Muslim population of Bengal and it had provided a major backing to the community residing in Kolkata by spreading the sport to a sizeable population during its foundation days. This led to communal rivalry with its cross-town competitors – East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, which were primarily supported by the Hindu population of Bengal during the early decades. The rivalries with both the teams have become non-communal and mostly insignificant over the course of time due to the rarity of their meetings at major tournaments. The club's youth team took part in Manchester United Premier Cup of India.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Mohun Bagan Super Giant, commonly referred to as Mohun Bagan, is an Indian association football club based in Kolkata, West Bengal. Founded in 1889, it is one of the oldest football clubs in Asia. The club competes in the Indian Super League, the top tier of Indian football league system. The club is most notable for its victory over the East Yorkshire Regiment in the 1911 IFA Shield final. This victory made Mohun Bagan the first all-Indian club to win a championship over a British club and was a major moment during India's push for independence.\r\n\r\nThe club is commonly referred to as Mohun Bagan, and had several sponsored names. In 2020, KGSPL, the company that owned ATK, took an 80% stake in the football division of Mohun Bagan alongside dissolving its own club. This disbanded club was absorbed into the football of Mohun Bagan and Mohun Bagan was rebranded as ATK Mohun Bagan FC. In 2023, the team was rebranded as Mohun Bagan Super Giant after continuous protest from the fans.\r\n\r\nTill now the club has won the top-flight football league a record six times — National Football League thrice, I-League twice and Indian Super League Shield once. They are one of the most successful Indian clubs in the history of the Federation Cup, having won the championship a record 14 times. The club have also won the 2022–23 ISL Cup. The club had also won several other trophies, including the Durand Cup (17 times), the IFA Shield (22 times), the Rovers Cup (14 times) and the Calcutta Football League (30 times).\r\n\r\nThe club annually contests in Asia's oldest rivalry, the Kolkata Derby against its long-time local rival East Bengal FC, with the first derby match being played on 8 August 1921. Mohun Bagan was one of the founding members of National Football League in 1996, and has never been relegated from the top-tier league of the country. In its 130th year of existence, the club was inducted into the \"Club of Pioneers\", a network of the oldest existing football clubs around the world, on 29 July 2019.",
