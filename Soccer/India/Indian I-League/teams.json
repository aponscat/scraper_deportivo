Shillong Lajong also takes part in regional competitions.\r\n\r\nShillong Lajong was incorporated in 1983, with the prime objective of improving the declining standard of football in the state, and to spot, train and nurture local talent. In the local Khasi language, Lajong translates to \"our own\". Nicknamed \"the Red Dragons\", Shillong Lajong briefly participated in I-League until their relegation in 2017, then top flight Indian football. They also appeared in the Indian Super Cup in 2018 and reached semi-finals. They were nominated for 2022–23 I-League 2 qualifiers. Headquartered in Shillong, Lajong has access to the largest student population in the North-East and hence the footballing talent right from a young age. The club is four-time champion of the Shillong Premier League.\r\n\r\nShillong Lajong was the first club from the North East region of India to rise to prominence in the country. Before the 2012–13 I-League season began, it was officially announced that Shillong Lajong's academy lad Ajal raj had signed his first professional contract with Shillong Lajong after his impressive performance in the North East Super Series during pre-season. Though Aizawl FC caught most of the attention after their I-League title in 2016, it was Lajong who were the torch-bearers of northeastern football for a large part of the decade.",
