They are the reserve team of the New York Red Bulls and play in the USL Championship, the second tier in the American soccer pyramid.\r\n\r\nRed Bull New York II were founded on January 21, 2015, when the New York Red Bulls acquired the rights to start a USL club. Red Bulls II competes in the second tier of American soccer and serves as a reserve side for the first team as well as a developmental stage for young prospects and academy players. The club follows in the footsteps of many MLS clubs who created USL sides to help promote youth development throughout the nation.\r\n\r\nIt was announced on March 2, 2015, that former MetroStars and Red Bulls player, John Wolyniec would be the club's new head coach. Wolyniec previously served as an assistant coach to the senior team and the academy. Former Red Bulls defender, Ibrahim Sekagya will also serve on his coaching staff.\r\n\r\nOn March 19, 2015, the soccer club announced the signing of their first-ever player, and former academy standout, Tyler Adams. Following their first signing, the club's first roster consisted of senior team players who were loaned down, draft picks, academy players and local trialists. A week later, on March 28, the club played in their inaugural match, drawing 0-0 against the Rochester Rhinos. Senior team loanee, Anatole Abang scored the club's first ever goal in a 4-1 victory against Toronto FC II, marking the first victory in club history.\r\n\r\nAfter spending the majority of the 2015 and 2016 season playing at Red Bull Arena, the club announced on May 10, 2016 that their new home field would be at Montclair State University's MSU Soccer Park at Pittser Field starting in 2017.\r\n\r\nThe club won their first ever trophy on September 7, 2016 claiming the Regular Season Title (the equivalent of the Supporters' Shield) 4-1 victory at Harrisburg City Islanders. On October 23, Red Bulls II won their first USL Cup after a 5-1 victory against Swope Park Rangers at Red Bull Arena.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Sporting Kansas City II are a USL Championship club affiliated with Sporting Kansas City of Major League Soccer. SKC II play their home games at Children's Mercy Park in Kansas City, Kansas. They were formerly known as the Swope Park Rangers.\r\n\r\nOn October 22, 2015, the team was officially announced as the USL's 30th franchise, as were the Swope Park Rangers name, color scheme and logo. The Rangers replaced Oklahoma City Energy FC as SKC's USL affiliate, and was named after a nickname for SKC reserve squad in 2008. The team is Sporting Kansas City's third USL affiliate in the team's history, after previously having partnered with Orlando City SC and Oklahoma City Energy FC. Canadian Marc Dos Santos, who led Ottawa Fury FC to the NASL Soccer Bowl in 2015, was named the first head coach of the Rangers on November 20, 2015.\r\n\r\nThe Rangers finished their inaugural season in 2016 with a 14–10–6 record and finished fourth in the Western Conference. The side advanced to the 2016 USL Cup Final, becoming just the second team in USL history to do so in its inaugural season. The Rangers beat LA Galaxy II, Orange County SC and Vancouver Whitecaps FC 2 en route to the final where the side eventually fell 5–1 to New York Red Bulls II at Red Bull Arena. Goalkeeper Adrian Zendejas and winger Tyler Pasher were each signed by parent club Sporting Kansas City at the end of the season.\r\n\r\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2016 season, Marc Dos Santos departed to take over at newly founded NASL club the San Francisco Deltas. His assistant for the 2016 campaign, Nikola Popovic, took the reins ahead of the 2017 season. The side continued to have success as Popovic led the team to a 17–8–7 record in the West and another fourth-place finish. Sporting KC also signed four more players from SPR during 2017 in Amer Didic, James Musa, Kharlton Belmar and Kevin Oliveira. Popovic resigned as head coach on November 17, 2017 after leading Swope Park to their second consecutive conference championship.\r\n\r\nOn September 30, 2019, the club announced that it would re-brand as Sporting Kansas City II ahead of the 2020 USL Championship season.",
