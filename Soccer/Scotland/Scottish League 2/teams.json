However the name Elgin City was used by two clubs prior to this. The first was formed in October 1879, but lasted for only a short time. The second Elgin City was formed in October 1884 and lasted till early 1887. The present club's first major honour came in the 1898â€“99 season when they became the first team outside Inverness to win the North of Scotland Cup, beating Clachnacuddin 2â€“1. However, they failed to record any more success aside from the Elgin District Cup until 1924 when they again won the North of Scotland Cup a second time. Since then they have won honours with relative frequency. In 1968 the club reached the quarter-finals of the Scottish Cup, the furthest into the tournament that a Highland League club has ever progressed.\r\n\r\nElgin City have played at Borough Briggs since 1921 when it replaced Cooper Park. The ground currently has a capacity of 4,520 (478 seated) and is the most northerly football league ground in the United Kingdom.",

One explanation for the origins of the Loons' moniker is that the second string were younger than the first team, so over time people would say \"I'm off to watch the Loons\".\r\n\r\nForfar share many local rivals in Angus, including Arbroath, Brechin City and Montrose, as well as the larger clubs of Dundee, Dundee United, St Johnstone and Aberdeen in the wider east of Scotland region.
