However the name Elgin City was used by two clubs prior to this. The first was formed in October 1879, but lasted for only a short time. The second Elgin City was formed in October 1884 and lasted till early 1887. The present club's first major honour came in the 1898–99 season when they became the first team outside Inverness to win the North of Scotland Cup, beating Clachnacuddin 2–1. However, they failed to record any more success aside from the Elgin District Cup until 1924 when they again won the North of Scotland Cup a second time. Since then they have won honours with relative frequency. In 1968 the club reached the quarter-finals of the Scottish Cup, the furthest into the tournament that a Highland League club has ever progressed.\r\n\r\nElgin City have played at Borough Briggs since 1921 when it replaced Cooper Park. The ground currently has a capacity of 4,520 (478 seated) and is the most northerly football league ground in the United Kingdom.",

One explanation for the origins of the Loons' moniker is that the second string were younger than the first team, so over time people would say \"I'm off to watch the Loons\".\r\n\r\nForfar share many local rivals in Angus, including Arbroath, Brechin City and Montrose, as well as the larger clubs of Dundee, Dundee United, St Johnstone and Aberdeen in the wider east of Scotland region.

The visitors won 3–0. On the opening game of the Scottish Third Division 2012–13 campaign, Peterhead achieved one of their greatest results by earning a 2–2 draw against Rangers, denied victory by an 89th-minute equaliser. On 20 January 2013 Peterhead hosted Rangers for a second time that season, the game was watched by 4,855 spectators. This is Balmoor's all-time record attendance with approximately 400 more fans than the previous fixture. On Saturday 18 April 2014, Peterhead clinched their first trophy as a football league club by winning the Scottish League Two title, beating Clyde 2–0 at Broadwood Stadium.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday 14 November 2015, Peterhead reached their first cup final since leaving the Highland League, beating Queen's Park to reach the Scottish Challenge Cup final.
