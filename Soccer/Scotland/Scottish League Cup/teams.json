            "strDescriptionEN": "Aberdeen Football Club (also known as The Dons or The Reds) are a Scottish professional football club based in Aberdeen. They compete in the Scottish Premiership having won four league titles and seven Scottish Cups, including a record three in a row during the 1980s, the only time a team other than Rangers has done this since 1882. They are also the only Scottish team to have won two European trophies, both in the same year, and have never been relegated from the top division of the Scottish football league system.\r\n\r\nFormed in 1903 as a result of the amalgamation of three clubs from Aberdeen, they rarely challenged for honours until the post war decade, when they won each of the major Scottish trophies under manager Dave Halliday. This level of success was surpassed in the 1980s, when, under the management of Alex Ferguson, they won three league titles, four Scottish Cups and a Scottish League Cup, alongside the European Cup Winners' Cup and the European Super Cup, both in 1983. Aberdeen were the last club outside of the Old Firm to win a league title, in 1984–85, and also the last Scottish team to win a European trophy. The team has enjoyed less success since this golden era, but a 19-year wait for a major trophy was ended by winning the 2013–14 Scottish League Cup.\r\n\r\nAberdeen have played at Pittodrie Stadium since their inception. The ground currently has a capacity of 21,421 and was the first all-seated and all-covered stadium in the United Kingdom. Pittodrie was also the first football stadium to feature a dugout, an invention of player and coach Donald Colman. The club's colours have been primarily red and white since 1939; before this, they played in black and gold vertical stripes. Aberdeen attract support from the city and surrounding areas, as they are the only senior team within a wide area. Aberdeen have no geographically close rivals; their nearest neighbours at the same level are in the city of Dundee.",

El club compite en la Scottish Premiership después de haber ganado cuatro títulos de Liga y siete Copas de Escocia, incluyendo un récord de tres consecutivas durante la década de 1980, la única vez que un equipo que no fue el Rangers lo ha hecho desde 1882. También son el único equipo escocés que ha ganado dos trofeos europeos, ambos en el mismo año, y es, junto con el Celtic, uno de los dos únicos equipos escoceses que nunca han descendido de la Premier League. A pesar de haber disputado la final de la Copa de Escocia 1999-00 y de la Scottish League Cup, el Aberdeen no ha ganado ningún título desde 1995.\r\n\r\nFundado en 1903 como resultado de la fusión de tres clubes de Aberdeen, rara vez lucharon por el título de Liga hasta la década de 1950, cuando ganaron todos los títulos más importantes de Escocia bajo el mandato de Dave Halliday. Este nivel de éxito fue superado en la década de 1980, cuando, bajo la dirección de Alex Ferguson, ganó tres títulos de Liga, cuatro Copas de Escocia y una Copa de la Liga de Escocia, junto con la Recopa de Europa de la UEFA y la Supercopa de Europa, ambos en 1983. El Aberdeen fue el último equipo fuera de la Old Firm en ganar un título de liga, en 1984—85, y también el último equipo escocés en ganar un trofeo europeo.\r\n\r\nEl club ha jugado en el Pittodrie Stadium desde su fundación. El terreno tiene actualmente una capacidad de 22.199 espectadores y fue el primer estadio con una capacidad totalmente sentada y todo cubierto en el Reino Unido. El Pittodrie también fue el estadio de fútbol de primera en presentar banquillos por debajo del nivel del terreno de juego, un invento del jugador y entrenador Donald Colman. Los colores del club han sido principalmente rojo y blanco desde 1939, y antes de esto, jugó con rayas verticales en blanco y oro.\r\n\r\nEl Aberdeen atrae el apoyo de la ciudad y sus alrededores, ya que son el único equipo superior dentro de una amplia zona.

            "strDescriptionEN": "Arbroath Football Club are a Scottish football club currently playing in the Scottish League Two. The club were founded in 1878 and play home matches at Gayfield Park. They play in maroon strips, and are nicknamed \"the Red Lichties\" due to the red light that used to guide fishing boats back from the North Sea to the burgh's harbour. Arbroath share a long-standing and fierce rivalry with local neighbours Montrose.\r\n\r\nThe team's most notable and lasting accomplishment is to hold the world record for the biggest victory in World senior football, set on 12 September 1885 when they beat Aberdeen Bon Accord 36–0 in a Scottish Cup match, with a further goal disallowed for offside. Jocky Petrie scored 13 goals in that game, a record for the most goals by a single player in a British senior match.\r\n\r\nThe team has had mixed success in recent years. In the 1996–97 season they hit the bottom of the Scottish senior football standard as they finished bottom of the Third Division. However, the following season they were promoted to the Second Division. They spent three years at this level before winning promotion to the First Division – arguably the club's greatest achievement in recent history. They finished 7th in their first season in the First Division, 13 points clear of relegation troubles. However, in the 2002–03 season, the team struggled badly, and finished bottom of the table, 20 points adrift of penultimate side Alloa Athletic. In the 2003–04 season, Arbroath narrowly avoided back-to-back relegations, as they escaped the drop on the last day of the season. In 2004–05, however, there was no escaping a 3–0 defeat at Dumbarton on 30 April 2005, which consigned the team to the Third Division for the following season.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in recent years the club has risen from the depths of the Third Division to the heights of the First Division, then fallen back down to the basement league. However, under manager John McGlashan, the club competed at the top of Division 3, finishing 4th in their first season and second in the next, reaching both divisional play-offs in seasons 2005–06 and 2006–07, although failing to gain promotion. Arbroath finished fourth in Division 3 and disposed of Cowdenbeath 2–1 on aggregate thanks to a late extra time winner from Robbie Raeside in the semi final. Stranraer were the opponents in the play-off final and the Lichties ran out 2–0 winners in the home tie first leg at Gayfield thanks to a Robbie Raeside header and a Barry Sellars strike. At Stranraer, the Arbroath goal was pummelled for much of the match and the Lichties spent much of the second half down to 10 men after Craig Tully had been red carded. Although one goal was conceded, a resolute defence saw the Lichties hold on for a 2–1 aggregate win and promotion.\r\n\r\nArbroath managed to consolidate their position in Division 2 in 2008–09. The season had started well but a narrow defeat in the Cooperative Insurance League Cup at Gayfield on penalties to SPL side Inverness Caledonian Thistle triggered a sequence of losses and the Lichties found themselves in the bottom half of the table. The performances were boosted by loan additions such as Steven Doris, Craig Forsyth and ex Scotland International, Colin Cameron and the team got results when it mattered. Safety was all but assured with a narrow 1–0 win over Queens Park at Hampden, courtesy of a fine Robbie Ross strike and a 2–0 victory over Stranraer at Gayfield with goals from Ross and Forsyth. A 2–2 draw against Peterhead and a 0–0 draw against Raith Rovers in May was enough to seal 7th spot.\r\n\r\nDuring season 2009–10, results seemed to go into free fall after a 6–0 home defeat to St Johnstone in the CIS Cup early in the season. John McGlashan resigned to be replaced by Jim Weir who after a mixed start eventually rallied the team to a spirited last few weeks of the season. With a win needed against East Fife to avoid the play-offs, the Lichties threw everything they had in the last 20 minutes to find a winner but to no avail. After beating Queens Park in the play-off semi final, their season ended with a 2–0 loss to Forfar Athletic in the final. Weir resigned to take up the vacant position at Brechin City, and was replaced, on 27 May, by Paul Sheerin.\r\n\r\nOn 23 April 2011, Arbroath defeated local rivals Montrose 4–1 to win the 2010–11 Third Division title; securing Arbroath's first senior honours in their 133-year history and a return to Second Division at their first attempt. Arbroaths next few seasons in the third tier (renamed League One) were a mixed rollercoaster. A tremendous first season playing lively attacking football saw them run champions Cowdenbeath closely, more than matching them in head-to-head counters but lacking the professional edge to grind out other results and losing the final three. The Lichties finished on 60 points and went out in the playoff semifinal. In 2012–13, a fairly mediocre season saw the side end up in 5th spot, on 52 points just pipped for the final playoff spot. One highlight was a 3rd Round Scottish Cup draw at Celtic Park 1–1 and then exiting in the replay due to a perfectly acceptable equaliser being ruled out.\r\n\r\nSeason 2013–14 was disastrous. After an average start, a run of 14 games without a win (and very few draws) saw the side end up bottom of the pile on 31 points and automatically relegated. Scoring was not really a problem but defence was. The attack-minded and purist emphasis of manager Sheerin, who continued as player-manager, meant most fans stayed supportive. Some poor signings were costly. Arbroath thus experienced their fourth relegation in 11 years. Sheerin left Gayfield in June 2014 to take up a post with the Under-20 side at Aberdeen. Allan Moore was subsequently appointed with Todd Lumsden as assistant. On Sunday, 12 April 2015, after a string of poor results in which the team only won once in 16 games, Moore was relieved of his duties as Manager and Lumsden took the helm. The team had been sitting at the top of the table by eight points in December but ended up finishing third and subsequently lost 3–2 on aggregate to Queens Park in the Play Off Semi Final.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Cove Rangers Football Club is a senior Scottish football club currently playing in Scottish League One. They are based in the Cove Bay area of Aberdeen and play their football at Balmoral Stadium, having left their former home at Allan Park in April 2015. \r\n\r\nCove were formed in 1922 and played in the local amateur leagues until 1985, when they became a junior team. However, the club applied and were accepted to the senior Highland Football League in 1986, where they played until winning promotion to Scottish Football League division 2 in May 2019, after beating Berwick Rangers 7–0 on aggregate in the pyramid playoff. They have also racked up a formidable reputation in the lower rounds of the Scottish Cup, reaching the 3rd round three times. In 2001 they won their first Highland League championship – but even more impressively won the 'treble' of Highland League, Aberdeenshire Shield and Scottish Qualifying Cup.\r\n\r\nIn the 2007–08 season, Cove reached round four of the Scottish Cup for the first time, beating Brora Rangers away 5–0, Keith 3–0 and Edinburgh University 1–0 on the way, before losing 4–2 to Ross County.\r\n\r\nHowever, the south Aberdeen side claimed their second ever Highland League Championship with a 3–0 home win against Lossiemouth on 3 May 2008.\r\n\r\nCove Rangers were one of the clubs who prepared an application for entry into the Scottish Football League following Gretna relinquishing their league status on 3 June 2008. The other clubs were Annan Athletic, Preston Athletic and Spartans. Annan Athletic were eventually awarded the place, due to their superior facilities.\r\n\r\nIn 2016 the club regained their Highland League crown in one of the greatest teams achievements in recent memory. Due to the introduction of the 'pyramid system', Cove were forced to say goodbye to their Allan Park home due to the stadium not meeting SPFL minimum stadia requirements. This in turn meant the club played all of their games at an away ground with Inverurie Locos, Formartine United and Banks O'Dee offering the use of their facilities so the club could compete. Cove went on to win the league and advance to the first play-off game against the winner of the Lowland League, Edinburgh City. The tie was won by City 4–1 on aggregate who subsequently progressed to Scottish League Two after beating East Stirlingshire in the second playoff tie.\r\n\r\nOne of the club's most famous players is the young Scottish midfielder Paul Coutts who joined English League One club Peterborough United during the summer of 2008 for a nominal fee. Coutts won the clubs's Young Player of the Year award for the 2008–09 season and won eight caps for the Scotland under-21 squad, after being touting for a call up by his former manager Darren Ferguson.\r\n\r\nIn the 2018–19 season they were promoted to SPFL League Two for the first time in their history after defeating Berwick Rangers 7–0 on aggregate in the League Two play-off.\r\n\r\nThe club's honorary president Alan McRae served as SFA president from 2015–2019.",

The club plays its home matches at Dens Park.\r\n\r\nThe club was formed after a merger between clubs Dundee East End and Dundee Our Boys in order to apply for the SFL. Within a decade they had become a major force in Scottish football, finishing as league runners-up three times in the 1900s, and finished the decade as Scottish Cup winners in 1910. They would remain a major side in Scottish football before a decline in the 1930s. After the return to football in the aftermath of World War II, the club experienced a revival in the late 1940s and 1950s under George Anderson with another runners-up finish and consecutive Scottish League Cup wins in 1952 and 1953.\r\n\r\nThe club's most successful era was in the 1960s when, under the management of Bob Shankly, Dundee won the Scottish Football League title in 1962, before reaching the semi-finals of the 1962–63 European Cup. The club would once again win the League Cup in the 1973–74 season, but have yet to win another major honour since. Since the late 1970s, the club has experienced issues with frequent relegations and financial issues, though have found stability in the latter as of late.\r\n\r\nThe club has a long-standing rivalry with fellow Dundee side Dundee United, who are situated on the same street. It is the most local football derby in Great Britain. Matches between the two are called the Dundee derby, and games are fiercely contested and are often considered one of the most exciting fixtures in Scottish football. Despite this, the rivalry is much friendlier than other Scottish derbies such as the Old Firm, with families often split down the middle in terms of support.",

The club regularly played European football in this period, reaching the semi-finals of the 1968–69 European Cup Winners' Cup under Farm.\r\n\r\nThe club have played at East End Park since their formation in 1885, however, the pitch they initially played at – also known as East End Park – was slightly west of the present stadium.\r\n\r\nAfter a period of relative success in the 2000s marked by appearances in three major finals (the 2004 Scottish Cup Final, the 2006 Scottish League Cup Final and the 2007 Scottish Cup Final), all of which were lost against Celtic, Dunfermline were relegated to the First Division in 2007. The club then encountered financial problems and, in April 2013, applied for and was granted full administration at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, and in October 2013, the fan group Pars United assumed control of the club.",

However the name Elgin City was used by two clubs prior to this. The first was formed in October 1879, but lasted for only a short time. The second Elgin City was formed in October 1884 and lasted till early 1887. The present club's first major honour came in the 1898–99 season when they became the first team outside Inverness to win the North of Scotland Cup, beating Clachnacuddin 2–1. However, they failed to record any more success aside from the Elgin District Cup until 1924 when they again won the North of Scotland Cup a second time. Since then they have won honours with relative frequency. In 1968 the club reached the quarter-finals of the Scottish Cup, the furthest into the tournament that a Highland League club has ever progressed.\r\n\r\nElgin City have played at Borough Briggs since 1921 when it replaced Cooper Park. The ground currently has a capacity of 4,520 (478 seated) and is the most northerly football league ground in the United Kingdom.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Falkirk Football Club are a Scottish professional association football club based in the town of Falkirk. The club was founded in 1876 and competes in the Scottish Championship as a member of the Scottish Professional Football League. The club was elected to the Second Division of the Scottish Football League in 1902–03, was promoted to the First Division after two seasons and achieved its highest league position in the early 1900s when it was runner-up to Celtic in 1907–08 and 1909–10. The football club was registered as a Limited Liability Company in April 1905 – Falkirk Football & Athletic Club Ltd.\r\n\r\nFalkirk won the Scottish Cup for the first time in 1913. After 1945, Falkirk were promoted and demoted between the Premier and First Divisions seven times until 1995–96, and during the 1970s spent three seasons in the Second Division. In 2005, Falkirk were promoted to the Scottish Premier League (SPL). Falkirk won the Scottish Cup again in 1957 and were runners-up in the competition in 1997, 2009 and 2015. As a result of its performance in the 2009 Scottish Cup, the club qualified for the inaugural season of the UEFA Europa League in 2009–10. Falkirk have won the second tier of Scottish football a record seven times, an honour shared with St. Johnstone. They have also won the Scottish Challenge Cup more than any other club, winning it for the fourth time in 2012.\r\n\r\nIn their early years, Falkirk played at three venues: Hope Street, Randyford Park and Blinkbonny Park. Between 1885 and 2003, the club was based at Brockville Park, built on the former Hope Street ground. After the creation of the SPL in 1998, its strict stadium criteria – to which Brockville Park did not conform – were enforced, and the club was denied promotion on three occasions. The club's present home ground since 2003 is the Falkirk Stadium, an 8,750 all-seater stadium on the outskirts of Falkirk.",

One explanation for the origins of the Loons' moniker is that the second string were younger than the first team, so over time people would say \"I'm off to watch the Loons\".\r\n\r\nForfar share many local rivals in Angus, including Arbroath, Brechin City and Montrose, as well as the larger clubs of Dundee, Dundee United, St Johnstone and Aberdeen in the wider east of Scotland region.

            "strDescriptionEN": "Heart of Midlothian Football Club, commonly known as Hearts, is a professional football club in Edinburgh, Scotland. The team competes in the Scottish Professional Football League. Hearts, the oldest and most successful football club in the Scottish capital, were formed in 1874, their name influenced by Walter Scott's novel The Heart of Midlothian. The club crest is based on the Heart of Midlothian mosaic on the city's Royal Mile; the team's colours are maroon and white.\r\n\r\nHearts have played home matches at Tynecastle Park since 1886. After converting the ground into an all-seater stadium in 1990, it now has a capacity of 19,852 following the completion of a rebuilt main stand in 2017. Their training facilities are at the Oriam, Scotland's national performance centre for sport, where they also run their youth academy.\r\n\r\nHeart of Midlothian have won the Scottish league championship four times, most recently in 1959–60, when they also retained the Scottish League Cup to complete a League and League Cup double – the only club outside of the Old Firm to achieve such a feat.\r\n\r\nThe club's most successful period was under former player turned manager Tommy Walker from the early 1950s to mid 1960s. Between 1954 and 1962 they won two league titles, one Scottish Cup, and four Scottish League Cups, and also finished inside the league's top four positions for 11 consecutive seasons between 1949–50 and 1959–60. Jimmy Wardhaugh, Willie Bauld and Alfie Conn Sr., known as the Terrible Trio, were forwards at the start of this period with wing half linchpins Dave Mackay and John Cumming. Wardhaugh was part of another notable Hearts attacking trinity in the 1957–58 league winning side. Along with Jimmy Murray and Alex Young, they set the record for the number of goals scored in a Scottish league winning campaign (132). In doing so, they also became the only side to finish a season with a goal difference exceeding 100 (+103).\r\n\r\nHearts have also won the Scottish Cup eight times, most recently in 2012 after a 5–1 victory over Hibernian, their local rivals. All four of Hearts' Scottish League Cup triumphs came under Walker, most recently a 1–0 victory against Kilmarnock in 1962. Their most recent Scottish League Cup Final appearance was in 2013, where they lost 3–2 to St Mirren.\r\n\r\nIn 1958, Heart of Midlothian became the third Scottish and fifth British team to compete in European competition. The club reached the quarter-finals of the 1988–89 UEFA Cup, losing to Bayern Munich 2–1 on aggregate.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Hibernian Football Club (\/hɨˈbɜrniən\/), commonly known as Hibs, are a Scottish professional football club based in Leith in the north of Edinburgh. It is one of two Scottish Professional Football League clubs in the city, the other being their Edinburgh derby rivals Hearts. Hibernian was founded in 1875 by Irish immigrants, but support for the club is now based on geography rather than ethnicity or religion. The Irish heritage of Hibernian is still reflected, however, in its name, colours and badge.\r\n\r\nThe name of the club is usually shortened to Hibs. The team are also called The Hibees (pronounced \/ˈhaɪbiːz\/) and The Cabbage, a shortening of the rhyming slang for Hibs of \"Cabbage and Ribs\", by fans of the club, who are themselves also known as Hibbies. Home matches are played at the Easter Road stadium, in use since 1893, when the club joined the Scottish Football League. Hibernian have played in the second tier of the Scottish football league system, known as the Scottish Championship, since being relegated in 2014.\r\n\r\nHibernian have won the Scottish league championship four times, most recently in 1952. Three of those four championships were won between 1948 and 1952, when the club had the services of The Famous Five, a notable forward line. The club have won the Scottish Cup twice, in 1887 and 1902; but have lost ten Scottish Cup Finals since, most recently in 2013. The last major trophy won by the club was the 2006–07 Scottish League Cup, when Kilmarnock were beaten 5–1 in the final. This was the third time Hibs had won the League Cup, also winning in 1972–73 and 1991–92.\r\nThe team reached the League Cup final, (2015–16) which was lost to Ross County. This was followed by victory in the Scottish Cup for the first time since 1902, culminating in a cup final win against Rangers. Soon after the cup win Stubbs left Hibs to manage Rotherham United. He was replaced by Neil Lennon, who led the team to promotion by winning the 2016–17 Scottish Championship.",

The new club was formed with a view to applying for one of the two vacancies in the Scottish Football League, created when the league restructured in 1994 to four divisions of ten teams each. They were successful and were elected to the Scottish Third Division along with Highland derby rivals Ross County. The club's name was amended to Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. in 1996 at the request of Inverness District Council. The council had contributed £900,000 towards the development of Caledonian Stadium, now known for sponsorship reasons as the Tulloch Caledonian Stadium. The stadium is situated beside the Moray Firth, in the shadow of the Kessock Bridge. Its construction was promised in their election to the Scottish Football League. The former ground of Caledonian, Telford Street, was used until the new stadium was complete.\r\n  Inverness CT were relegated to the Scottish Championship on the final day of the 2016–17 season, despite recording a 3–2 victory over Motherwell.",

In 1995, the club was relocated to Livingston, West Lothian and renamed after the town. Since then Livingston have played their home games at Almondvale Stadium. In the ten years following the move to Livingston the club enjoyed notable success, winning promotion to the Scottish Premier League in 2001, qualifying for the UEFA Cup in its maiden season in the top flight (finishing third behind Celtic and Rangers) and winning the 2004 Scottish League Cup. However, the club hit financial problems in 2004, and was relegated to the Scottish First Division in 2006. In July 2009 the club faced further financial problems and were on the verge of suffering a liquidation event before a deal was struck. Livingston were subsequently demoted to the Scottish Third Division, but the club achieved consecutive promotions and went on to regain its place in the top tier after winning the 2017–18 Scottish Premiership play-offs.",

Despite their name, the club are based at Firhill Stadium in the Maryhill area of the city, and have not played in Partick since 1908. The club have been members of the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) since its formation in 2013. In the 2020–21 season, Thistle won Scottish League One, the third tier of the SPFL structure, and returned to the Scottish Championship, having been relegated from there in 2019–20.\r\n\r\nSince 1936, Thistle have played in their distinctive red-and-yellow jerseys of varying designs, with hoops, stripes and predominantly yellow tops with red trims having been used, although in 2009 a centenary kit was launched in the original navy-blue style to commemorate 100 years at Firhill. Since 1908 the club have won the Scottish Second Division (third tier, now Scottish League One) twice and the Scottish First Division (second tier, now the Scottish Championship) six times, most recently in 2013. Thistle have won the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup in 1921 and 1971 respectively.\r\n\r\nThe club are currently managed by Ian McCall in his second spell in charge. Under Alan Archibald's management, the club achieved promotion to the newly formed Scottish Premiership in 2013, and remained there for five consecutive seasons. During this spell Thistle secured major investment and in 2017 finished in the top six of Scottish football for the first time in over three decades. Key players such as Kris Doolan broke numerous records and became one of the club's top goal scorers. Despite relegation in the 2017–18 Scottish Premiership season, Archibald remained as Thistle's manager. However, after a poor start to the 2018–19 Scottish Championship campaign Archibald's 5-year tenure came to an end. He returned to the club as McCall's assistant in 2019.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Peterhead Football Club are a football club based in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. They will play in Scottish League Two in the 2023–24 season after being relegated in 2022–23.\r\n\r\nTheir home ground is Balmoor in Peterhead, with a capacity of 3,150. The current manager is Jim McInally, who was appointed on 7 October 2011 following the sacking of John Sheran on 23 September 2011 after the side won only one game in 17 matches.\r\n\r\nPeterhead's traditional rivals are the Highland League team Fraserburgh; however, since their election to the Scottish Football League this rivalry has waned. They now have a new rivalry with Elgin City. On 22 November 2011, Peterhead earned a game against Celtic in the Scottish Cup, which was held at their stadium, Balmoor, on 8 January 2012. The visitors won 3–0. On the opening game of the Scottish Third Division 2012–13 campaign, Peterhead achieved one of their greatest results by earning a 2–2 draw against Rangers, denied victory by an 89th-minute equaliser. On 20 January 2013 Peterhead hosted Rangers for a second time that season, the game was watched by 4,855 spectators. This is Balmoor's all-time record attendance with approximately 400 more fans than the previous fixture. On Saturday 18 April 2014, Peterhead clinched their first trophy as a football league club by winning the Scottish League Two title, beating Clyde 2–0 at Broadwood Stadium.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday 14 November 2015, Peterhead reached their first cup final since leaving the Highland League, beating Queen's Park to reach the Scottish Challenge Cup final. The club were beaten 4–0 by Rangers at Hampden Park, with over 2,000 travelling from Peterhead to cheer the Blue Toon.",

For many years the club was the only fully amateur club in the Scottish professional leagues, until its membership voted to end that status in November 2019. The club's amateur status was reflected by its Latin motto, 'Ludere Causa Ludendi' – 'To Play for the Sake of Playing'.\r\n\r\nQueen's Park is also the only Scottish football club to have played in the FA Cup Final, achieving this feat in both 1884 and 1885. With 10 titles, Queen's Park has won the Scottish Cup the third most times of any club, behind only Rangers and Celtic, although their last such win was in 1893. Queen's were the record holders of the Scottish Cup for 51 years until the 1924–25 season when their record was overtaken by Celtic, who then won the Cup for an 11th time.\r\n\r\nFor over a century the club's home was Hampden Park in south-east Glasgow, a Category 4 stadium which is also the home of the Scotland national team. The club are due to move into their reserve and training ground adjacent to the main stadium, Lesser Hampden, with plans to redevelop it into a 1774-seat stadium.",

Con 55 trionfi nel proprio campionato risulta essere la squadra con il maggior numero di titoli nazionali in tutto il panorama mondiale, insieme alla squadra nordirlandese del Linfield, oltre a 33 trionfi nella Coppa di Scozia e 27 nella Coppe di Lega, anch'esso un record. Assieme al Celtic, detengono il primato di treble nazionali con 7 affermazioni nella loro storia (1949, 1974, 1976, 1978, 1993, 1999 e 2003). I Rangers sono stati il primo club britannico a raggiungere una finale di un torneo UEFA e hanno vinto la Coppa delle Coppe UEFA nel 1972 dopo avere già raggiunto la finale in due occasioni: nel 1961 e nel 1967. Una terza finale in Europa è stata quella relativa alla Coppa UEFA 2008, arrivata dopo l'eliminazione nella fase a gironi della Champions League dello stesso anno, dove circa 200.000 sostenitori si recarono a Manchester, pur essendo la finale contro lo Zenit di San Pietroburgo in realtà vista da circa 44.000 spettatori allo stadio City of Manchester. Con la vittoria della Scottish Premier League nel 2005, i Rangers hanno conquistato il 51º titolo nazionale della loro storia (prima squadra al mondo a riuscire in questa impresa), motivo per cui sulle maglie da gioco lo stemma del club è sormontato da cinque stelle, ognuna delle quali rappresenta 10 campionati vinti. Insieme ai rivali cittadini del Celtic forma la cosiddetta Old Firm del calcio scozzese, uno dei derby più antichi e più intensi nel calcio mondiale.",

Although it is officially recorded as being formed in 1884, the club did not play its first game until February 1885. The club's home since 1989 has been McDiarmid Park.\r\n\r\nSt. Johnstone won the Scottish Football League First Division, the second tier of league football in Scotland, in 2008–09. This gained them promotion to the Scottish Premier League, bringing a return of SPL football to McDiarmid Park for the 2009–10 campaign, after a seven-year absence. The club have historically floated between the top two divisions of Scottish football, obtaining the reputation of being a \"yo-yo club\". Their traditional rivals are the two Dundee clubs, Dundee and Dundee United, with matches between St. Johnstone and either Dundee club being called Tayside derbies.\r\n\r\nThe club has had limited success in cup competitions. After losing at the semi-finals stage on numerous occasions, the club won their first Scottish Cup in 2014 with a 2–0 win over rivals Dundee United. It has reached two Scottish League Cup Finals, losing them to each of the Old Firm clubs. St. Johnstone won its first national cup competition of the modern era in the 2007–08 Scottish Challenge Cup. The club had previously won the Scottish Consolation Cup in 1911 and 1914, and the B Division Supplementary Cup in 1949.
