            "strDescriptionEN": "Aberdeen Football Club (also known as The Dons or The Reds) are a Scottish professional football club based in Aberdeen. They compete in the Scottish Premiership having won four league titles and seven Scottish Cups, including a record three in a row during the 1980s, the only time a team other than Rangers has done this since 1882. They are also the only Scottish team to have won two European trophies, both in the same year, and have never been relegated from the top division of the Scottish football league system.\r\n\r\nFormed in 1903 as a result of the amalgamation of three clubs from Aberdeen, they rarely challenged for honours until the post war decade, when they won each of the major Scottish trophies under manager Dave Halliday. This level of success was surpassed in the 1980s, when, under the management of Alex Ferguson, they won three league titles, four Scottish Cups and a Scottish League Cup, alongside the European Cup Winners' Cup and the European Super Cup, both in 1983. Aberdeen were the last club outside of the Old Firm to win a league title, in 1984–85, and also the last Scottish team to win a European trophy. The team has enjoyed less success since this golden era, but a 19-year wait for a major trophy was ended by winning the 2013–14 Scottish League Cup.\r\n\r\nAberdeen have played at Pittodrie Stadium since their inception. The ground currently has a capacity of 21,421 and was the first all-seated and all-covered stadium in the United Kingdom. Pittodrie was also the first football stadium to feature a dugout, an invention of player and coach Donald Colman. The club's colours have been primarily red and white since 1939; before this, they played in black and gold vertical stripes. Aberdeen attract support from the city and surrounding areas, as they are the only senior team within a wide area. Aberdeen have no geographically close rivals; their nearest neighbours at the same level are in the city of Dundee.",

El club compite en la Scottish Premiership después de haber ganado cuatro títulos de Liga y siete Copas de Escocia, incluyendo un récord de tres consecutivas durante la década de 1980, la única vez que un equipo que no fue el Rangers lo ha hecho desde 1882. También son el único equipo escocés que ha ganado dos trofeos europeos, ambos en el mismo año, y es, junto con el Celtic, uno de los dos únicos equipos escoceses que nunca han descendido de la Premier League. A pesar de haber disputado la final de la Copa de Escocia 1999-00 y de la Scottish League Cup, el Aberdeen no ha ganado ningún título desde 1995.\r\n\r\nFundado en 1903 como resultado de la fusión de tres clubes de Aberdeen, rara vez lucharon por el título de Liga hasta la década de 1950, cuando ganaron todos los títulos más importantes de Escocia bajo el mandato de Dave Halliday. Este nivel de éxito fue superado en la década de 1980, cuando, bajo la dirección de Alex Ferguson, ganó tres títulos de Liga, cuatro Copas de Escocia y una Copa de la Liga de Escocia, junto con la Recopa de Europa de la UEFA y la Supercopa de Europa, ambos en 1983. El Aberdeen fue el último equipo fuera de la Old Firm en ganar un título de liga, en 1984—85, y también el último equipo escocés en ganar un trofeo europeo.\r\n\r\nEl club ha jugado en el Pittodrie Stadium desde su fundación. El terreno tiene actualmente una capacidad de 22.199 espectadores y fue el primer estadio con una capacidad totalmente sentada y todo cubierto en el Reino Unido. El Pittodrie también fue el estadio de fútbol de primera en presentar banquillos por debajo del nivel del terreno de juego, un invento del jugador y entrenador Donald Colman. Los colores del club han sido principalmente rojo y blanco desde 1939, y antes de esto, jugó con rayas verticales en blanco y oro.\r\n\r\nEl Aberdeen atrae el apoyo de la ciudad y sus alrededores, ya que son el único equipo superior dentro de una amplia zona.

            "strDescriptionEN": "Arbroath Football Club are a Scottish football club currently playing in the Scottish League Two. The club were founded in 1878 and play home matches at Gayfield Park. They play in maroon strips, and are nicknamed \"the Red Lichties\" due to the red light that used to guide fishing boats back from the North Sea to the burgh's harbour. Arbroath share a long-standing and fierce rivalry with local neighbours Montrose.\r\n\r\nThe team's most notable and lasting accomplishment is to hold the world record for the biggest victory in World senior football, set on 12 September 1885 when they beat Aberdeen Bon Accord 36–0 in a Scottish Cup match, with a further goal disallowed for offside. Jocky Petrie scored 13 goals in that game, a record for the most goals by a single player in a British senior match.\r\n\r\nThe team has had mixed success in recent years. In the 1996–97 season they hit the bottom of the Scottish senior football standard as they finished bottom of the Third Division. However, the following season they were promoted to the Second Division. They spent three years at this level before winning promotion to the First Division – arguably the club's greatest achievement in recent history. They finished 7th in their first season in the First Division, 13 points clear of relegation troubles. However, in the 2002–03 season, the team struggled badly, and finished bottom of the table, 20 points adrift of penultimate side Alloa Athletic. In the 2003–04 season, Arbroath narrowly avoided back-to-back relegations, as they escaped the drop on the last day of the season. In 2004–05, however, there was no escaping a 3–0 defeat at Dumbarton on 30 April 2005, which consigned the team to the Third Division for the following season.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in recent years the club has risen from the depths of the Third Division to the heights of the First Division, then fallen back down to the basement league. However, under manager John McGlashan, the club competed at the top of Division 3, finishing 4th in their first season and second in the next, reaching both divisional play-offs in seasons 2005–06 and 2006–07, although failing to gain promotion. Arbroath finished fourth in Division 3 and disposed of Cowdenbeath 2–1 on aggregate thanks to a late extra time winner from Robbie Raeside in the semi final. Stranraer were the opponents in the play-off final and the Lichties ran out 2–0 winners in the home tie first leg at Gayfield thanks to a Robbie Raeside header and a Barry Sellars strike. At Stranraer, the Arbroath goal was pummelled for much of the match and the Lichties spent much of the second half down to 10 men after Craig Tully had been red carded. Although one goal was conceded, a resolute defence saw the Lichties hold on for a 2–1 aggregate win and promotion.\r\n\r\nArbroath managed to consolidate their position in Division 2 in 2008–09. The season had started well but a narrow defeat in the Cooperative Insurance League Cup at Gayfield on penalties to SPL side Inverness Caledonian Thistle triggered a sequence of losses and the Lichties found themselves in the bottom half of the table. The performances were boosted by loan additions such as Steven Doris, Craig Forsyth and ex Scotland International, Colin Cameron and the team got results when it mattered. Safety was all but assured with a narrow 1–0 win over Queens Park at Hampden, courtesy of a fine Robbie Ross strike and a 2–0 victory over Stranraer at Gayfield with goals from Ross and Forsyth. A 2–2 draw against Peterhead and a 0–0 draw against Raith Rovers in May was enough to seal 7th spot.\r\n\r\nDuring season 2009–10, results seemed to go into free fall after a 6–0 home defeat to St Johnstone in the CIS Cup early in the season. John McGlashan resigned to be replaced by Jim Weir who after a mixed start eventually rallied the team to a spirited last few weeks of the season. With a win needed against East Fife to avoid the play-offs, the Lichties threw everything they had in the last 20 minutes to find a winner but to no avail. After beating Queens Park in the play-off semi final, their season ended with a 2–0 loss to Forfar Athletic in the final. Weir resigned to take up the vacant position at Brechin City, and was replaced, on 27 May, by Paul Sheerin.\r\n\r\nOn 23 April 2011, Arbroath defeated local rivals Montrose 4–1 to win the 2010–11 Third Division title; securing Arbroath's first senior honours in their 133-year history and a return to Second Division at their first attempt. Arbroaths next few seasons in the third tier (renamed League One) were a mixed rollercoaster. A tremendous first season playing lively attacking football saw them run champions Cowdenbeath closely, more than matching them in head-to-head counters but lacking the professional edge to grind out other results and losing the final three. The Lichties finished on 60 points and went out in the playoff semifinal. In 2012–13, a fairly mediocre season saw the side end up in 5th spot, on 52 points just pipped for the final playoff spot. One highlight was a 3rd Round Scottish Cup draw at Celtic Park 1–1 and then exiting in the replay due to a perfectly acceptable equaliser being ruled out.\r\n\r\nSeason 2013–14 was disastrous. After an average start, a run of 14 games without a win (and very few draws) saw the side end up bottom of the pile on 31 points and automatically relegated. Scoring was not really a problem but defence was. The attack-minded and purist emphasis of manager Sheerin, who continued as player-manager, meant most fans stayed supportive. Some poor signings were costly. Arbroath thus experienced their fourth relegation in 11 years. Sheerin left Gayfield in June 2014 to take up a post with the Under-20 side at Aberdeen. Allan Moore was subsequently appointed with Todd Lumsden as assistant. On Sunday, 12 April 2015, after a string of poor results in which the team only won once in 16 games, Moore was relieved of his duties as Manager and Lumsden took the helm. The team had been sitting at the top of the table by eight points in December but ended up finishing third and subsequently lost 3–2 on aggregate to Queens Park in the Play Off Semi Final.",

A second centre based in Edinburgh opened in 2014. From the 2014–15 season onwards, they fielded a team under the Edusport Academy name in Scottish senior football, the only private academy to do so in a recognised senior league. They initially played in the South of Scotland League before winning promotion to the Lowland League in 2017. As Edusport, the senior team played at the Hamilton Palace Sports Ground in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire (2014–2015) and Galabank in Annan, Dumfries and Galloway (2015–2019).\r\n\r\nFrom 2018 onwards, the senior team began to operate separately from the academy after launching a membership scheme, Our Football Club. In 2019 they were rebranded as Caledonian Braves and opened their own Alliance Park ground within Strathclyde Country Park in North Lanarkshire.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "The Celtic Football Club, commonly known as Celtic (\/ˈsɛltɪk\/), is a professional football club in Glasgow, Scotland. The team competes in the Scottish Premiership, the top division of Scottish football. The club was founded in 1887 with the purpose of alleviating poverty in the Irish–Scots population in the city's East End area. They played their first match in May 1888, a friendly match against Rangers which Celtic won 5–2. Celtic established themselves within Scottish football, winning six successive league titles during the first decade of the 20th century. The club enjoyed their greatest successes during the 1960s and 70s under Jock Stein, when they won nine consecutive league titles and the 1967 European Cup. Celtic have played in green and white throughout their history, adopting in 1903 the hoops that have been used ever since.\r\n\r\nCeltic are one of only five clubs in the world to have won over 100 trophies. The club has won the Scottish league championship 54 times, most recently in 2023–24, the Scottish Cup a record 42 times and the Scottish League Cup 21 times. The club's greatest season was 1966–67, when Celtic became the first British team to win the European Cup, also winning the Scottish league championship, the Scottish Cup, the League Cup and the Glasgow Cup. Celtic also reached the 1970 European Cup Final and the 2003 UEFA Cup Final, losing in both.\r\n\r\nCeltic have a long-standing fierce rivalry with Rangers and, together, the clubs are known as the Old Firm. Their matches against each other are regarded as among the world's biggest football derbies. The club's fanbase was estimated in 2003 as being around 9 million worldwide and there are more than 160 Celtic supporters clubs in over 20 countries. An estimated 80,000 fans travelled to Seville for the 2003 UEFA Cup Final, and their \"extraordinarily loyal and sporting behaviour\" in spite of defeat earned the club Fair Play awards from FIFA and UEFA, respectively.",

I giocatori del Celtic vengono soprannominati The Bhoys.\r\n\r\nInsieme ai rivali storici dei Rangers forma la cosiddetta Old Firm del calcio scozzese, una delle più forti e accese rivalità sportive di tutti i tempi. Il Celtic viene tradizionalmente associato alla comunità cattolica di Glasgow (ha anche un nutritissimo seguito tra i tifosi irlandesi), mentre i Rangers ne rappresentano la parte protestante. A livello nazionale ha vinto 53 campionati, 41 Coppe di Scozia e 21 Coppe di Lega, per un totale di 115 trofei nazionali, che la rendono la seconda squadra più titolata, dietro ai concittadini dei Rangers. I trofei totali, con la Coppa dei Campioni vinta nel 1966-1967, sono 116.\r\n\r\nNel 1966-1967 il Celtic divenne il primo club britannico a vincere la Coppa dei Campioni,[1] la cui vittoria era fino a quel momento rimasta appannaggio di club provenienti da Italia, Portogallo e Spagna. Nello stesso anno vinse ogni competizione alla quale partecipò (record in assoluto per una squadra scozzese): Scottish Premier League, Scottish Cup, Scottish League Cup e Glasgow Cup. È l'unico club scozzese ad avere raggiunto la finale di Coppa dei Campioni e il solo in Europa ad averlo fatto con soli giocatori provenienti dal vivaio (tutti i tesserati erano scozzesi e nati a meno di 30 miglia dal Celtic Park).[2][3] Con questo risultato fu la prima squadra europea a centrare il treble stagionale (vittoria di Campionato, Coppa nazionale e Coppa dei Campioni). I Bhoys arrivarono nuovamente in finale di Coppa dei Campioni nel 1970, ma questa volta vennero battuti dagli olandesi del Feyenoord per 1-2 ai tempi supplementari. Nel 2003 la squadra, guidata da Martin O'Neill, raggiunse la finale di Coppa UEFA, giocatasi a Siviglia, dove fu però sconfitta dal Porto per 2-3 ai tempi supplementari. Circa 80 000 tifosi bianco-verdi partirono per lo Stadio Olimpico de la Cartuja per seguire il match, nonostante la maggior parte di essi non fosse in possesso di alcun biglietto.[4][5][6]\r\n\r\nLa divisa del Celtic è conosciuta in tutto il mondo, grazie alle sue strisce orizzontali bianco-verdi con pantaloncini e calzettoni bianchi. La squadra disputa i suoi incontri interni al Celtic Park, il terzo impianto per capienza del Regno Unito. Nella stagione 2005-2006 lo stadio registrò una media di circa 58 149 paganti,[7] seconda miglior affluenza media dell'epoca in Gran Bretagna dopo l'Old Trafford di Manchester.[8]\r\n\r\nA novembre del 2021 il Celtic occupa il 49º posto nel Ranking UEFA per club",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Cove Rangers Football Club is a senior Scottish football club currently playing in Scottish League One. They are based in the Cove Bay area of Aberdeen and play their football at Balmoral Stadium, having left their former home at Allan Park in April 2015. \r\n\r\nCove were formed in 1922 and played in the local amateur leagues until 1985, when they became a junior team. However, the club applied and were accepted to the senior Highland Football League in 1986, where they played until winning promotion to Scottish Football League division 2 in May 2019, after beating Berwick Rangers 7–0 on aggregate in the pyramid playoff. They have also racked up a formidable reputation in the lower rounds of the Scottish Cup, reaching the 3rd round three times. In 2001 they won their first Highland League championship – but even more impressively won the 'treble' of Highland League, Aberdeenshire Shield and Scottish Qualifying Cup.\r\n\r\nIn the 2007–08 season, Cove reached round four of the Scottish Cup for the first time, beating Brora Rangers away 5–0, Keith 3–0 and Edinburgh University 1–0 on the way, before losing 4–2 to Ross County.\r\n\r\nHowever, the south Aberdeen side claimed their second ever Highland League Championship with a 3–0 home win against Lossiemouth on 3 May 2008.\r\n\r\nCove Rangers were one of the clubs who prepared an application for entry into the Scottish Football League following Gretna relinquishing their league status on 3 June 2008. The other clubs were Annan Athletic, Preston Athletic and Spartans. Annan Athletic were eventually awarded the place, due to their superior facilities.\r\n\r\nIn 2016 the club regained their Highland League crown in one of the greatest teams achievements in recent memory. Due to the introduction of the 'pyramid system', Cove were forced to say goodbye to their Allan Park home due to the stadium not meeting SPFL minimum stadia requirements. This in turn meant the club played all of their games at an away ground with Inverurie Locos, Formartine United and Banks O'Dee offering the use of their facilities so the club could compete. Cove went on to win the league and advance to the first play-off game against the winner of the Lowland League, Edinburgh City. The tie was won by City 4–1 on aggregate who subsequently progressed to Scottish League Two after beating East Stirlingshire in the second playoff tie.\r\n\r\nOne of the club's most famous players is the young Scottish midfielder Paul Coutts who joined English League One club Peterborough United during the summer of 2008 for a nominal fee. Coutts won the clubs's Young Player of the Year award for the 2008–09 season and won eight caps for the Scotland under-21 squad, after being touting for a call up by his former manager Darren Ferguson.\r\n\r\nIn the 2018–19 season they were promoted to SPFL League Two for the first time in their history after defeating Berwick Rangers 7–0 on aggregate in the League Two play-off.\r\n\r\nThe club's honorary president Alan McRae served as SFA president from 2015–2019.",

They were founded in 1938 and play their football at the Princess Royal Park in the town of Banff, (formerly Banffshire, now officially Aberdeenshire), Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe club was formed in 1938 when Deveron Valley and Banff Rovers joined together. The name comes from the River Deveron, which has its mouth at Banff.\r\n\r\nAfter they were formed, it took them one year to get into the Highland League. In August 1939, Deveronvale played their first league game. Their first win came a month later. In 1948 Deveronvale signed James ‘Jimmy’ Williamson from Dunipace Juniors, Jimmy would go on to play for Deveronvale for 7 years and in the process set the record for highest number of individual goals In the highland league at 197 goals. The crest of Deveronvale FC was designed during the early 1970s by local school teacher, Mr. Chris Murray. He chose a 'heraldic' seagull to represent the twin fishing towns of Banff and Macduff.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 the Vale won the Highland League title for the first time in their history and repeated this feat once more three years later.\r\n\r\nDue to them being a senior team, they can play in the Scottish Cup. In the 2006–07 season, Deveronvale made it into the fourth round of the Scottish Cup after a 5–4 defeat of Third Division side Elgin City, before going out at home to First Division side Partick Thistle.\r\n\r\nIn the 2011–12 season, Deveronvale entered the Scottish Challenge Cup for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe club celebrated its 80th anniversary in the 2018-19 season.",

The club plays its home matches at Dens Park.\r\n\r\nThe club was formed after a merger between clubs Dundee East End and Dundee Our Boys in order to apply for the SFL. Within a decade they had become a major force in Scottish football, finishing as league runners-up three times in the 1900s, and finished the decade as Scottish Cup winners in 1910. They would remain a major side in Scottish football before a decline in the 1930s. After the return to football in the aftermath of World War II, the club experienced a revival in the late 1940s and 1950s under George Anderson with another runners-up finish and consecutive Scottish League Cup wins in 1952 and 1953.\r\n\r\nThe club's most successful era was in the 1960s when, under the management of Bob Shankly, Dundee won the Scottish Football League title in 1962, before reaching the semi-finals of the 1962–63 European Cup. The club would once again win the League Cup in the 1973–74 season, but have yet to win another major honour since. Since the late 1970s, the club has experienced issues with frequent relegations and financial issues, though have found stability in the latter as of late.\r\n\r\nThe club has a long-standing rivalry with fellow Dundee side Dundee United, who are situated on the same street. It is the most local football derby in Great Britain. Matches between the two are called the Dundee derby, and games are fiercely contested and are often considered one of the most exciting fixtures in Scottish football. Despite this, the rivalry is much friendlier than other Scottish derbies such as the Old Firm, with families often split down the middle in terms of support.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Dunfermline Athletic Football Club is a Scottish football club based in the city of Dunfermline, Fife. Founded in 1885, the club currently play in the Scottish Championship after winning the 2022–23 Scottish League One title. Dunfermline play at East End Park, are nicknamed The Pars and are currently managed by James McPake. \r\n\r\nThe Pars' most successful period was in the 1960s, when the side won the Scottish Cup twice, in 1961 and 1968 under the management of Jock Stein and George Farm respectively. The club regularly played European football in this period, reaching the semi-finals of the 1968–69 European Cup Winners' Cup under Farm.\r\n\r\nThe club have played at East End Park since their formation in 1885, however, the pitch they initially played at – also known as East End Park – was slightly west of the present stadium.\r\n\r\nAfter a period of relative success in the 2000s marked by appearances in three major finals (the 2004 Scottish Cup Final, the 2006 Scottish League Cup Final and the 2007 Scottish Cup Final), all of which were lost against Celtic, Dunfermline were relegated to the First Division in 2007. The club then encountered financial problems and, in April 2013, applied for and was granted full administration at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, and in October 2013, the fan group Pars United assumed control of the club.",
