They were founded in 1938 and play their football at the Princess Royal Park in the town of Banff, (formerly Banffshire, now officially Aberdeenshire), Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe club was formed in 1938 when Deveron Valley and Banff Rovers joined together. The name comes from the River Deveron, which has its mouth at Banff.\r\n\r\nAfter they were formed, it took them one year to get into the Highland League. In August 1939, Deveronvale played their first league game. Their first win came a month later. In 1948 Deveronvale signed James ‘Jimmy’ Williamson from Dunipace Juniors, Jimmy would go on to play for Deveronvale for 7 years and in the process set the record for highest number of individual goals In the highland league at 197 goals. The crest of Deveronvale FC was designed during the early 1970s by local school teacher, Mr. Chris Murray. He chose a 'heraldic' seagull to represent the twin fishing towns of Banff and Macduff.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 the Vale won the Highland League title for the first time in their history and repeated this feat once more three years later.\r\n\r\nDue to them being a senior team, they can play in the Scottish Cup. In the 2006–07 season, Deveronvale made it into the fourth round of the Scottish Cup after a 5–4 defeat of Third Division side Elgin City, before going out at home to First Division side Partick Thistle.\r\n\r\nIn the 2011–12 season, Deveronvale entered the Scottish Challenge Cup for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe club celebrated its 80th anniversary in the 2018-19 season.",

Forres Mechanics have won the Highland league twice: in the 1985–86 season and in the 2011–12 season.\r\n\r\nOn 26 November 2016, Forres Mechanics played their most high-profile match in recent years when they held League One side Stenhousemuir to a 2–2 draw in 2016–17 Scottish Cup, however they lost 3–1 in the replay.\r\n\r\nForres withdrew from the Highland League in the 2020–21 season, which was greatly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.",

The club was founded in 1928 and plays at Christie Park in Huntly.\r\n\r\nHuntly F.C. was formed in 1928. They were unanimously accepted to the Highland League at the league's AGM in June 1928. The club entered the league in season 1928–29 and the first game was against Inverness Thistle on Saturday 25 August 1928. In only its second league campaign, Huntly became only the third team outside Inverness to win the league, finishing two points ahead of closest rivals Elgin City and Inverness Thistle. However, the club would have to wait 64 years for another championship win and to a lot of supporters the greatest moment in the club's history. The club then won the Highland League in a record five successive seasons between 1993 and 1998.\r\n\r\nIn December 1975 the Referee's Committee of the Scottish Football Association ordered the closure of Christie Park for two months following an incident in which a referee was knocked to the ground by a supporter making his way home across the pitch after a match. The club were also fined £100 and ordered to have Police on duty at all future matches.\r\n\r\nIn January 2008 Huntly reached the 4th Round proper of the Scottish Cup following victories against Fraserburgh, Annan Athletic and Culter, and although drawn at home to Division 1 team Dundee, they eventually lost 1–3. In September 2009, the club became part of a match fixing probe after a 7–0 win against (then) East of Scotland side Hawick Royal Albert in a Scottish Cup tie. Suspicions arose due to alleged irregular betting patterns surrounding the final score and the awarding of a penalty to Huntly during the game. Nothing was proven and no further actions were taken.",

On National Railway Company 'Grouping' in 1923, the GNSR became part of the London & North Eastern Railway, one of the UK's big four railway companies at that time, and the football club lived on. The Locomotive Workshops themselves were formally closed in 1970 on the forming of British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL), a wholly owned subsidiary of the British Railways Board at that time.\r\n\r\nDespite the closure, Inverurie Loco Works F.C. continued to play. Having competed in the Aberdeenshire and North East Junior Leagues for many years, they became a senior club in 2001 when their application to join the SHFL was successful.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Turriff United Football Club are a senior football club currently playing in the Highland Football League in Scotland. They play their matches at The Haughs, beside the River Deveron in Turriff, Aberdeenshire. They joined the Highland League for the 2009–10 season, having been accepted into the league on 25 February 2009. Prior to joining the Highland League, they were a Scottish Junior Football Association club, playing in the Scottish Junior Football North Premier League.\r\n\r\nTurriff finished in the top half of the table only once in their first five seasons in the Highland League, but their fortunes improved significantly in the 2014–15 season. The club recovered from early-season setbacks (their heaviest-ever league defeat, 8–0 by defending champions Brora Rangers, followed by a three-point penalty for fielding an ineligible player in their opening match) to beat their previous record of 16 wins in a season with 14 matches still to play. Turriff went on to compile a 23-match unbeaten run, during which they briefly led the league table following a 1–0 win over Deveronvale on 3 January 2015, and again following a 3–0 victory over Huntly four weeks later. On both occasions the second-placed club, Brora Rangers, had two games in hand. Turriff remained Brora's closest rivals for the rest of the season, until Brora finally took the title with a 2–1 win over Turriff at The Haughs on 28 March. A week later, Turriff secured second place when a draw between their own closest rivals, Cove Rangers and Wick Academy, left both clubs unable to close the gap.\r\n\r\nThe club made its Scottish Cup debut in 2012, beating Burntisland Shipyard, Civil Service Strollers and Buckie Thistle to reach the fourth round, in which a 1–1 draw at home to Greenock Morton made them the last surviving non-SFL\/SPL side in the competition, before being knocked out in the replay.\r\nIn 2013–14, Turriff reached the third round, beating Selkirk and Wick Academy before going out to Stirling Albion. In 2014–15 they beat Lossiemouth in the first round, before losing to Clyde in the second. By virtue of finishing as runners up in the Highland League, they entered the 2015–16 competition in the second round, before losing to Fraserburgh.\r\n\r\nChanges to the entry criteria of the Scottish Challenge Cup allowed Turriff to take part for the first time in 2016-17. They reached the third round, losing to Hibernian. The game set a new home attendance record for Turriff (1,791) and was their first match to be televised live (on BBC Alba).\r\n\r\nTurriff's most consistent success as a senior club has been in the Aberdeenshire Shield competition, which they have won three times. During the 2013–14 competition, their semi-final match against Cove Rangers was declared void and ordered to be replayed after it emerged that both teams had fielded ineligible players (in Turriff's case, the player was an unused substitute). The decision was to Turriff's advantage, as they had lost the original match - but went on to win the replay and so reach the final for the second year running.\r\nIn 2015, they again beat Cove Rangers in the semi-final to become finalists three years in a row.\r\n\r\nThe club's official mascot is Moo the Coo, an anthropomorphised male counterpart to the town's unofficial emblem, the Turra Coo.",
