The club is considered the heir of Union Sportive de Rabat-Salé, founded on 1932, which was the first nationalist club in Morocco according to the late Père Jégo, one of the Moroccan football historic symbols. This club was dissolved by the French authorities in 1944.\r\n\r\nAfter the foundation of Fath Union Sport de Rabat. the French authorities refused it integration to the French National Football League under the pretext that it was a nationalist club. But the problem was finally solved after having Mohammed V surgery.\r\n\r\nRelationship with Prince Moulay Abdallah\r\nPrince Moulay Abdallah was one of the biggest fans of FUS de Rabat and also the honorary president of the club, he supported the team financially and helped to attend many goals that are still entrenched in the memories of all Moroccan football fans.\r\n\r\nThe late prince used to come to the stadium to see the training session without being recognized and to organize friendly games to harden the club's players and make them more efficient.\r\n\r\nTitles\r\nAlthough Fath de Rabat is one of the biggest clubs in Morocco, it has only 5 titles won in the Moroccan Throne Cup respectively in 1967, 1973, 1976, 1995 and 2010.

The final match was finished by the score of 2–0, the goals had been scored by Postnov and Hammou.\r\n\r\nOn November 25, 2010 FUS de Rabat won their last cup in Stade Moulay Abdellah after overthrowing the team of Maghreb Fez by the score of 2–1.

Raja was founded in 20 March 1949 as part of the political struggle against French rule by nationalists who aimed to create a focus for working-class young Moroccans. The club is most well known outside Morocco for its football team.\r\n\r\nIn Morocco, Raja Casablanca is still regarded as the club of the people. For many years it had a reputation of playing entertaining football without winning many trophies. However Raja has evolved recently into a more professional outfit capable of winning trophies at home and abroad. Since 1949, Raja CA has been crowned domestic champions on eleven occasions, and has never been relegated to the Second Division.\r\n\r\nOn the continental side, Raja has won more CAF trophies than any other Moroccan team. The club has 3 CAF Champions League, 1 CAF Super Cup titles and 2 CAF Cup titles. Raja Casablanca placed third in 2000 in CAF's ranking of African clubs of the last century, finishing behind the Egyptian teams Al Ahly and Zamalek. The club was listed as one of the most valuable football clubs in Africa and one of the most widely supported teams in the continent and the first in its country.\r\n\r\nInternationally, Raja has also won 1 Afro-Asian Cup title. Raja Casablanca is the first Moroccan and African club to participate in the FIFA Club World Cup. They competed in the first edition that took place in 2000 in Brazil. Raja Casablanca became the second club to reach the FIFA Club World final as the representative of CAF, after TP Mazembe, as well as the host nation's national champions, after Brazilian club Corinthians, and the first under the current seven-club format since the 2007 edition, as they defeated Atlético Mineiro at the semi-final of 2013 FIFA Club World Cup with the Tunisian coach Faouzi Benzarti",
