The owner of the original CSKA, Grisha Ganchev let the club to go bankrupt and used the license of Litex Lovech to participate in the elite as CSKA-Sofia, which led to disagreements and controversies among members of the club, thus resulting in the creation of CSKA 1948.\r\n\r\nIts biggest rival to date is CSKA Sofia, as both clubs are claiming to be the rightful successor of CSKA Sofia, but the owner of the emblem and the team which is playing at Armiata is CSKA Sofia so CSKA - 1948 is just a GMO.",

Ludogorets are also the second Bulgarian team, after Levski Sofia, to enter the group stage of the UEFA Champions League, a feat which they achieved in the following 2014–15 season. During that same campaign, they became the first Bulgarian team to score points in the modern Champions League group stage following a 1–0 win over Basel in Sofia.\r\n\r\nSince their introduction to the Bulgarian top-flight in 2011, Ludogorets have established themselves as a dominant force in Bulgarian football, claiming every possible league title since then. They have also won the Bulgarian Cup twice, as well as the Bulgarian Supercup on four separate occasions.\r\n\r\nLudogorets' traditional home colours are green and white.

Spartak plays its home matches at the local Stadion Spartak.\r\n\r\nSpartak established itself as one of the pioneering teams in Bulgarian football. They won the Bulgarian league in 1932, and were runners up in 1931 and 1933. Spartak have spent the majority of their existence in the first two tiers of Bulgarian football, although their last top flight participation has been during season 2008-09, a negative streak of 12 seasons outside the top level. This dark period was marked by inconsistency in terms of both results on the pitch and financial problems. The negative streak ended in 2022, when Spartak returned to the top level following promotion.\r\n\r\nSpartak's nickname is the \"Falcons\", and they have a very heated rivalry with fellow Varna-based club, Cherno More. Matches between the two sides are known as the \"Derby of Varna\".",
