            "strDescriptionEN": "\"FC Bruno's Magpies, also known as FCB Magpies, is a football team from Gibraltar. They play in the Gibraltar National League and the Rock Cup.\r\n\r\nThe club was formed in 2013, initially as a group of friends who drank at the Bruno's Bar & Restaurant (A bar in Gibraltar). In its first two seasons, the club achieved respectable mid-table finishes in the Gibraltar Second Division. Mick Embleton was appointed the first manager of the team and was instrumental in the initial setting up\/ organizing\/ managing of the squad.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of Chestertons, a Gibraltarian real estate agent, as the sponsor in 2015\/16, the intent grew more serious, with moves to professionalise the club and establish a fanbase with the introduction of matchday programs and incentives for fans who attended games. The club finished fourth in that season and were the runners-up in the Second Division Cup, losing in extra time to Second Division champions Europa Point.\r\n\r\nIn October 2016, the club appointed Davie Wilson as manager, who has previously been assistant-manager the Gibraltar national football team and had recently departed Gibraltar Premier Division side Lions. The club enjoyed a dominant start to the campaign, however a faltering winter saw them embroiled in a title race with the resurgent Gibraltar Phoenix. Ending the season in second place, they entered the play-off with Manchester 62, who finished 9th in the 2016–17 Gibraltar Premier Division. However, a 3–1 defeat ensured that The Magpies will remain in the Second Division next season.\r\n\r\nIn August 2017, the club announced a new sponsorship deal with GVC Holdings. The side finished 3rd in the league that season, however, in May 2019 they completed a league and cup double, securing the Second Division title while also winning the Second Division Cup. After the season concluded, the club announced that former Watford chairman and British Olympian Haig Oundjian had purchased a stake in the club and become co-chairman with Louis Perry.\"",

Originally formed in 1975, they currently play in the Gibraltar National League.\r\n\r\nFormed in 1975, College spent the majority of their existence moving between the top two divisions in Gibraltar, with second and third teams playing elsewhere in the pyramid. During this time, they went through several variations of their name, most notably College Cosmos, before entering into a partnership with the reforming Europa in 2013, bring in extra resources as the Gibraltar Football Association joined UEFA. This saw an immediate upturn in results, and saw College Europa qualify for the UEFA Europa League at the first attempt via the 2014 Rock Cup. However, in 2015 the partnership between the two sides ended, and while the newly independent Europa retained their place in the Gibraltar Premier Division, the Dolphins, now calling themselves College 1975, were forced to start anew in the Gibraltar Second Division.\r\n\r\nSince the split, the side largely constructed by player-manager Nolan Bosio competed in the Second Division, reaching the final of the Second Division Cup in 2017, until the two divisions in Gibraltar merged in 2019. With a new management brought in under chairman Joseph Mir, a large scale rebuild of the squad took place, including the establishment of an under-23 side for the Gibraltar Intermediate League. Despite this, the side struggled on their return to the top flight, picking up a solitary point in a 5–5 draw with Europa Point, in their final match before the season was abandoned.",

The club, known for its \"Stepping Stone Club\" philosophy, currently plays in the Gibraltar National League the top senior tier of association football in Gibraltar. They also participate in the Rock Cup, the territory's primary cup competition.\r\n\r\nThe club formed in 2014 amidst the growing interest in association football on the territory of Gibraltar. Led by chairman John Gontier, the club held trials specifically aimed at bringing in youth team players that had been released by professional sides in England and Spain with the goal of getting them back into competitive football. Before their maiden season, the club also announced a partnership with Chesterfield in League One, where the English side has first option on any Europa Point player.\r\n\r\nAfter a strong start to the season, including a tight promotion challenge against Gibraltar United, the club narrowly missed out on promotion, finishing third in the league despite having the strongest goalscoring record in the Gibraltar Second Division. Despite missing out on promotion on the final day of the season, the club did end the season with silverware as they beat promoted side Angels FC 5–3 in a thrilling final that went to extra time.\r\n\r\nAfter missing out on promotion in 2014–15, Europa Point FC were crowned champions of the 2015–16 Gibraltar Second Division after an unbeaten league campaign (W17 D5) and completed the double by retaining the Gibraltar Second Division Cup by beating FC Brunos Magpies 3–2 A.E.T in the final. In preparation for the new season in the Premier Division they have signed many players including ex-Norwich players George Jermy and Tom Walters. Canadians Will Sykes and Uday Arora as well as Charles Mallmann and Álvaro Arias Pérez. However, the players failed to impress and despite substantial changes in playing and coaching staff throughout the season, Europa Point finished bottom of the Premier Division and were relegated.\r\n\r\nOn 1 November 2017, it was announced that an American consortium headed by Peter Grieve and Corey Woolfolk had purchased a controlling stake in Europa Point. Woolfolk took over as chairman of the club, while John Gontier moved to CEO. On 10 November, Joaquin Rodriguez was announced as the new Head of Commercial and Football Operations. As part of the takeover, Europa Point became a partner club to Bantu Rovers in Zimbabwe. Gontier negotiated to re-take control of the club in early 2019, helping the club to a second-place finish in the league.",

However, the emergence of Lincoln Red Imps saw Glacis's dominance decline, and their 17th and final title to date came in the 1999–2000 season. Since then, the club have settled into mid-table in Gibraltar, with the club particularly struggling since the GFA joined UEFA in 2013. The recruitment of Manuel Jimenez Perez in 2016, however, saw a more successful season with the club finishing 4th in the 2016–17 season, challenging St Joseph's for 3rd place and UEFA Europa League qualification. Manager Manuel Jimenez Perez left at the end of the season, and was replaced by Mariano Marcos Garcia on 9 July 2017. Juan Andrés Espinosa was announces as his assistant.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Lions Gibraltar is a professional football club in Gibraltar. They play in the country's top-level league, the Gibraltar National League.\r\n\r\nThey were created by a merger of Gibraltar United F.C. and Lions FC in 2011. Aside from their first team, they also run an intermediate (under-23) team, several youth teams, futsal teams and a women's team.\r\n\r\nLions Gibraltar was founded as Lions Football Club in 1966 when a group of friends decided to take up a team after the euphoria of England winning the 1966 World Cup, thus the three lions on its club badge. After a quiet 45-year history, the club merged with league giants Gibraltar United in 2011 to create a much stronger side.\r\n\r\nTheir time together saw the side consistently compete in the Gibraltar Premier Division, and the side continued this upon the GFA's admittance to UEFA in 2013. The 2013–14 season, their final season united with Gibraltar United, saw them narrowly avoid a relegation playoff with a 6th-place finish. After this, Gibraltar United joined the Gibraltar Second Division and Lions restructured, with English coach Jeff Wood appointed manager with ambitions to challenge the top sides and qualify for the UEFA Europa League. In February 2015 the club announced plans to become a feeder club with Premier League club Swansea City, although these plans eventually fell through.\r\n\r\nHowever, after a disappointing season in which the club finished bottom of the league (avoiding relegation due to the league's expansion), the club announced in July 2015 that it was to be taken over by Hercules Sports Promotion, Ltd, headed by Andrew Flowers (who had previously attempted to purchase Leeds United in 2013). Significant investment by the new ownership meant that Lions would now become a semi-professional club with the aim of toppling Lincoln Red Imps' dominance. The following season saw immediate improvement, with the club finishing 4th, however they remained significantly off the pace compared to the region's top two sides Lincoln Red Imps and Europa.\r\n\r\nOn 31 May, the board announced former national team coach David Wilson as their new manager for the 2016–17 season. However, after the collapse of the club owners' other companies left Lions' future uncertain, Wilson resigned before the beginning of the season to take over at FCB Magpies and the previous season's co-caretaker Rafael Bado was announced as manager. A season spent primarily in the bottom two ended in safety, however, after an upturn in form from the beginning of 2017 despite only winning one game in the first 4 months of the season.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Mons Calpe S.C. is a professional football and sporting club from Gibraltar. Founded in 2013, the club's first team plays in the Gibraltar National League. Mons Calpe also has a U-23 squad, futsal teams and darts.\r\n\r\nMons Calpe S.C. was formed by Kieran Alman, James Read, Phillip Debono, Richard Lavagna and Adrian Ballestero in 2013 after Gibraltar's admittance into UEFA sparked a boom in interest in football on the Rock. After an impressive maiden season in the 2013–14 Gibraltar Second Division, the club finished second in the league. However, the club succumbed to a 2–0 defeat to St Joseph's in the promotion\/relegation playoff that year. The following season saw the club struggle to emulate the same form, against much stronger promotion contenders, which saw the club lingering in mid-table for much of the season and eventually finishing 8th.\r\n\r\nAfter a significant rebuild over the summer of 2015, Mons Calpe had a second chance at promotion through the end-of-season playoff against Premier Division side FC Britannia. A victory in that game saw the young club seal their first-ever season in the top-flight of Gibraltarian football.\r\n\r\nThe summer after gaining promotion, Mons Calpe's football structure went through a total reconstruction to further professionalise the club, highlighted by a majority-share investment by a US-based group led by Jose Alfredo Reygadas. The Calpeans then appointed Brazilian\/Portuguese coach William Amaral de Andrade as first team head coach and former Gibraltar U19 Manager Terrence Jolley as his assistant manager for the 2016–17 season. After a bad run of form in winter saw them slip from 3rd to 5th, William was sacked on 16 January and replaced by Jolley on an interim basis. On 17 March, Italian manager Mauro Ardizzone was appointed head coach, with Jolley returning to his role as assistant. Ardizzone eventually saw the Calpeans to a 5th-place finish in their maiden Premier Division season, including a notable 2–2 draw with Lincoln Red Imps in the penultimate round.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the 2017–18 season, the Calpeans named Albert Ferri as their new manager. However, poor results led to his dismissal in December 2017, and renowned Argentinean manager Luis Manuel Blanco replaced him as first team head coach. After Blanco's arrival, the club won 14 of their next 22 matches in all competitions, finishing with a club-high 44 points in the top-flight and reaching the Rock Cup final, losing 2–1 to Europa.\r\n\r\nThe 2018–19 season started slowly, but Mons Calpe put together a serious challenge for a European spot, putting together the best season in its short history in the Premier Division. The club ended with its highest point total (49) and best position in the league table (4th), only 6 points behind St. Joe's for the last UEFA Europa League berth, despite beating the Saints twice and drawing once in their 3 regular season match-ups. The Calpeans also made a deep run in the Rock Cup, beating St. Joseph's again 4–1 in the quarterfinal, but falling short of a second consecutive Cup final after losing 1–0 to Gibraltar United in the semifinal. Manager Blanco left his role at the club on 28 May 2019.",
