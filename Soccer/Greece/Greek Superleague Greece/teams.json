(Greek: ΠΑΕ ΑΕΚ), also known simply as AEK, AEK Athens (in european competitions), or with its full name Athlitiki Enosis Konstantinoupoleos (Greek: Αθλητική Ένωσις Κωνσταντινουπόλεως, Athletic Union of Constantinople), is a Greek association football club based in Nea Filadelfeia suburb of Athens.\r\n\r\nEstablished in Athens in 1924 by Greek refugees from Constantinople in the wake of the Greco-Turkish War, A.E.K. is one of the most successful clubs in Greek football, winning 29 national titles (including 11 Championships, 14 Greek Cups, 1 League Cup and 3 Super Cups). The team has appeared several times in European (UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League) competitions. AEK is a member of the European Club Association.\r\n\r\nThe club was relegated from the Greek Superleague after the 2012–13 season for the first time in its history. In an effort to discharge the immense debt created by years of mismanagement, its directors chose for the team to compete in the third tier Football League 2 for the 2013-14 season, thus turning the club into an amateur club.\r\n\r\nThe large Greek population of Constantinople, not unlike those of the other Ottoman urban centres, continued its athletic traditions in the form of numerous athletic clubs. Clubs such as Enosis Tataoulon (Ένωσις Ταταούλων) and Iraklis (Ηρακλής) from the Tatavla district, Megas Alexandros (Μέγας Αλέξανδρος) of Vathyriakos, Hermes (Ερμής – Ermis) of Galata, Olympias (Ολυμπιάς) of Therapia, and Kati Kioi (Κατί Κίοϊ) of Chalcedon existed to promote Hellenic athletic and cultural ideals. These were amongst a dozen Greek-backed clubs that dominated the sporting landscape of the city in the years preceding World War I. After the war, with the influx of mainly French and English soldiers to Constantinople, many of the city clubs participated in regular competition with teams formed by the foreign troops. Taxim, Pera and Tatavla became the scene of weekly competitions in not only football, but of athletics, cycling, boxing and tennis.\r\n\r\nOf the clubs in the city, though, football was dominated by Enosis Tataoulon and Hermes. Hermes, one of the more popular clubs, was formed in 1875 by the Greek community of Pera (Galata). Forced to change its name to Pera Club in 1921, many of its athletes, and those of most other sporting clubs, fled during the population exchanges at the end of the Greco-Turkish War, and settled in Athens and Thessaloniki.",

(Greek: Oλυμπιακός Σύνδεσμος Φιλάθλων Πειραιώς, transliterated \"Olympiakós Sýndesmos Filáthlo̱n Peiraió̱s\", Olympiacos Club of Fans of Piraeus), are a Greek professional football club, part of the major multi-sport club Olympiacos CFP, based in Piraeus. Their name was inspired from the Ancient Olympic Games and along with the club's emblem, the laurel-crowned adolescent Olympic winner, encompass and symbolize the morality, the honour, the vying, the splendor, the sportsmanship and the fair play value of the Olympic ideal of Ancient Greece.\r\n\r\nFounded on 10 March 1925, Olympiacos is the most successful club in Greek football history, having won 42 Greek League titles, 27 Greek Cups, 17 Doubles and 4 Greek Super Cups, for a total of 73 national titles, all records. Olympiacos' dominating success can be further evidenced by the fact that all the other Greek clubs have won a combined total of 37 League titles.\r\n\r\nOlympiacos also holds the record for the most consecutive Greek League titles, as they are the only team to have won seven consecutive League titles (1997–2003), having broken their own previous record of six consecutive from the club's trophy-laden era of the 50s (1954–1959), when Olympiacos gained unequivocally the nickname of Thrylos (The Legend).\r\n\r\nIn 2014–15 season, Olympiacos won their fifth consecutive Greek Championship and reached a historic milestone, as they became the only football club in the world to have won a series of five or more consecutive championships for five times in their history, a world record that was praised by FIFA in its congratulatory letter to the club. Olympiacos holds even more records in Greek football history; they are the only club to have won five consecutive Greek Cups from 1957 to 1961 and the only club to have won six Greek League titles undefeated (1937–1938, 1948, 1951, 1954–1955). They are also one of only three clubs to have never been relegated from the top flight of Greek football. As a result of the team's 40th League title in the 2012–13 season, Olympiacos earned the 4th star above their crest, each star representing 10 League titles of the record 42 they have currently amassed.\r\n\r\nIn European competitions, they have reached the quarter-finals of the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League and the quarter-finals of the 1992–93 European Cup Winners' Cup. Olympiacos are the highest ranked Greek team in the UEFA rankings, occupying the 21st place in Europe with 70.820 points, standing one place above Shakhtar Donetsk and two places above A.C. Milan. They have also won the Balkans Cup in 1963, becoming the first ever Greek club to win an international, non-domestic competition. Olympiacos is one of the founding members of the European Club Association in 2008.\r\n\r\nThe club's home ground is the Karaiskakis Stadium in Piraeus. Olympiacos is the most popular Greek club with around three million fans inside Greece and millions of others in the Greek communities all over the world. Olympiacos was placed ninth on the 2006 list of clubs with the largest number of paying members, with 83,000 registered members as of April 2006. In 2014, that figure increased and the team boasts 98,000 registered members. They share a great and long-standing rivalry with Panathinaikos, with whom they contest the derby of the eternal enemies.\r\n\r\nOlympiacos supporters have been involved in the worst tragedy that ever hit Greek sports, known as the Karaiskakis Stadium disaster (8 February 1981). Twenty-one supporters lost their lives in Gate 7, while rushing out of the stadium to celebrate the 6–0 victory of Olympiacos against AEK Athens.",

(Greek: ΠΑΕ ΠΑΟΚ), or with its full name Panthessalonikios Athlitikos Omilos Royfianon (Greek: Πανθεσσαλονίκειος Αθλητικός Όμιλος Ρουφιάνων, transliterated Pan-Thessaloniki Athletic Club of Pimps), and commonly known as PAOK (Greek: ΠΑΟΚ, pronounced ), is a Greek association football club, a part of A.C. PAOK, based in Thessaloniki, Greece. They play their home games at Toumba Stadium, with a capacity of 28.703 seats.\r\n\r\nPAOK was established in 12 April 1926 in Turkey, by Greek Constantinopolitans who fled to Thessaloniki from the city of Constantinople in the wake of the Greco-Turkish War. Emblem of the team is a Byzantine-style double-headed chicken.\r\n\r\nPAOK currently plays in the top-flight Superleague Greece, which they have won twice (1975–76 and 1984–85). They have won also four times the Greek Football Cup (in 1971–72, 1973–74, 2000–01 and 2002–03 seasons). The team has appeared several times in the UEFA Europa League competition. Their best European performance was in the 1973–74 season, when they reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. PAOK is an ordinary member of the European Club Association.\r\n\r\nPAOK's traditional rivalries are against Olympiakos due to match fixing from both sides and the \"Thessaloniki's derby\" against Aris because of the complex of paok fans.",
