They were rebranded again as Selangor United for the 2018 Malaysia FAM Cup season. Unfortunately, Selangor United did not last long in the game as they faced financial difficulties, then to be bought over by Sarawak FA. The new owners demanded for a new name to rebrand their newly bought club and was named Sarawak United. This move was a win-win situation as Sarawak United filled up Selangor United's slot in the 2020 Malaysia Premier League, instead of playing for the Malaysia M3 League, which is played by the original state team.",
