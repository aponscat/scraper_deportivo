            "strDescriptionEN": "Futbol Club Barcelona Femení is the women's football section of FC Barcelona, based in Barcelona, Spain. FC Barcelona Femení is Spain's most successful women's club both domestically and in Europe, having won six league titles, eight Copas de la Reina, one Spanish Supercup, and one UEFA Women's Champions League.\r\n\r\nFormed in 1970 by 18-year-old Inmaculada \"Imma\" Cabecerán, the club was an establishing member of Spain's first recognized women's league, the Primera División (founded as the Liga Nacional). Although being closely associated with the club for decades, the team was not established as an official section of FC Barcelona until 2002, when the club definitively incorporated Club Femení Barcelona into its sports structure. Through battles with promotion and relegation, the club won their first league title in 2011, and for the next 4 years won 7 major titles: 4 league titles and 3 Copas de la Reina.\r\n\r\nSince the club's professionalization in 2015, Barcelona has become Spain's most successful team in the UEFA Women's Champions League. They were the first Spanish club to reach a quarterfinal of the Champions League, the first to reach a semifinal of the Champions League, the first to make it to a Champions League Final, and the first to win it, which they did in 2021. By winning the Champions League, FC Barcelona became the first club to win a Champions League title for both its men and women's footballing sections. They later became the first Spanish women's team to complete a continental treble after winning the 2020-21 Copa de la Reina.\r\n\r\nFC Barcelona Femení belongs to one of the four professional football clubs in Spain whose legal entity is not that of a sports corporation (SAD), as its ownership rests with its partners, or socis. Barcelona, along with Athletic Club, Real Madrid, and Madrid CFF are also the only clubs in the league not part of Spain's Association of Women's Football Clubs (ACFF).",
