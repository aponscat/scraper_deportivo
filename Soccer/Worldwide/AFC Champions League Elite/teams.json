The oldest and best known section of the club is the football team, which was founded in 1932 under the name Montakhab Al-Shorta and they are the third-oldest existing football club in the country.\r\n\r\nThey are one of Iraq's most successful clubs and they are the only existing Iraqi team to win a major top-tier continental club competition, having lifted the Arab Champions League trophy in 1982 after a 4–2 aggregate win over Al-Nejmeh in the final. They also reached the final of the AFC Champions League in 1971, where they refused to face Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv in protest at the Israeli occupation of Palestine, instead waving the Palestinian flag around the field. They were referred to as champions by the Arab media and were greeted with a heroes' reception upon their return to Baghdad, holding an open top bus parade, with Israel being expelled from the AFC three years later. The club has added two stars above their logo to represent these two achievements.\r\n\r\nThey are the reigning champions of the Iraqi Premier League, having won the title in the 2018–19 season. They also won a joint record three Iraqi Elite Cups, in 2000, 2001 and 2002, being the only team to win that trophy three consecutive times. Al-Shorta hold numerous Premier League records in Iraq, such as the longest unbeaten run, the fewest losses in a season, the fewest goals conceded in a season, the most consecutive wins in a season, the most consecutive games scored in and the most seasons played in the top-flight.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Central Coast Mariners FC is an Australian professional soccer club based on the Central Coast of New South Wales. It competes in the A-League, under licence from Football Federation Australia (FFA). The Mariners was founded in 2004 as one of the eight original A-League teams. It was the first professional sports club from the Gosford region to compete in a national competition. Despite being considered one of the smallest-market clubs in the league, Central Coast Mariners has won the A-League Premiership twice and claimed one A-League Championship from four Grand Final appearances. The club has also appeared in the AFC Champions League four times.\r\n\r\nThe club plays matches at Central Coast Stadium, a 20,059-seat stadium in Gosford; its purpose-built training facility, Mariners Centre of Excellence, is located in the suburb of Tuggerah. The facility is also home to a youth team that competes in the National Youth League. The English Football League One's Sheffield United has invested in the Central Coast-based club, and the Mariners has affiliation agreements with several international clubs.\r\n\r\nThe Mariners' main supporters' group is known as the Yellow Army, for the colour of the club's home kit. The club shares a rivalry with Newcastle Jets, known as the F3 Derby, after the previous name of the motorway that connects the cities of the teams. Matt Simon is the Mariners' all-time leading goalscorer as of December 2014, with 43 goals in all competitions. The team record for matches played is held by John Hutchinson, who has appeared in 252 games with the Mariners as of December 2014.",
