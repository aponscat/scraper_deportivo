            "strDescriptionEN": "Idrettslaget Hødd is a multi-sports club from Ulsteinvik in Møre og Romsdal, Norway. Founded in 1919, it has sections for team handball, gymnastics and football. It is best known for their men's football team, which plays at Høddvoll Stadion, whose stated capacity is 3,120, although there was an attendance of over 12,000 at a match against Vålerenga in 1981.\r\n\r\nHødd are currently playing in Second Division, the third tier of Norwegian football. They played in the top tier in 1966, 1969–72 (4 seasons) and 1995 and is the club who has played most seasons at the second tier. Hødd won the Norwegian Cup in 2012.\r\n\r\nIdrottslaget Hødd was founded on 1 August 1919. The name derives from Höðr, which was a gifted archer in Norse mythology, and means \"battle\" or \"fight\". Before the Second World War, the football team was not competitive with the two big clubs in the region, Rollon and Aalesund. Hødd was first promoted to the Landsdelserien (second tier) in 1950, and was close on promotion to Hovedserien in both the 1951–52 season and the 1958–59 season, but lost the promotion in the play-off against Ranheim and Brage respectively. Hødd also reached the third round of the Norwegian Football Cup on several occasions during the 1950s, where they were eliminated by first-tier teams.\r\n\r\nHødd was promoted to the First Division for the first time in the 1965 season when they won their Second Division group ahead of Rosenborg and Brann on goal difference, after Rosenborg lost 2–1 against Brann in the decisive match while Hødd won 8–2 against Kvik Trondheim on Lerkendal Stadion. Kjetil Hasund was the big star on the team, but there were also other good players on the team like Hallbjørn Hasund, Hans Gisle Holstad, Jan Ulfstein, Tor Meinseth and Otto Sundgot. As a small team from a small place in the outskirts of Norway, the national media dubbed Hødd to be relegtaed in its first season in the top-flight. The pundits were right and Hødd were relegated from the 1966 Norwegian First Division, but the team performed well and was only one point short of avoiding relegation. All the players stayed at the club after the relegation, and were again promoted to the top-flight in the 1968 season.\r\n\r\nWhen Hødd was back in the First Division, the team had learned its lesson and for the next three season the team had a miraculous ability to avoid relegation. As favourites to be relegated, Hødd won 3–1 against Sarpsborg in the last match of the 1969 season while Start won 2–0 against Lyn. These results saved Hødd from relegation as they finished level on points but with better goal difference then Start and Lyn, who were relegated. That Lyn was relegated was quite a surprise, as the team had won the double in the previous season and played the quarterfinal of the 1968–69 European Cup Winners' Cup against Barcelona. Hødd reached the quarter-final of the Norwegian Football Cup for the first time in 1969, where they lost 1–3 against Fredrikstad. The next season, Hødd again avoided relegation with better goal difference then the relegated team, after Hødd won 6–0 against Pors while Skeid lost 1–0 against Strømsgodset in the decisive match, and Skeid was relegated. In the 1971 season, Hødd won 5–0 against Frigg in the penultimate match and avoided relegation two points ahead of Frigg. After four seasons in the first-tier league, Hødd were relegated in 1972.\r\n\r\nAfter playing in the Second Division in the 1970s, Hødd were relegated in the 1980 season and were playing at the third tier for the first time since 1964. With Terje Skarsfjord as head coach the team won promotion to the Second Division and reached the quarterfinal of the 1981 Norwegian Football Cup. The third-tier team met the defending Norwegian Football Cup champions Vålerenga in the quarterfinal at Høddvoll, and Hødd scored the first goal before Vålerenga turned the match into a 2–1 victory. The match was watched by 12,300 spectators, which is the club's record attendance. Jan Åge Fjørtoft and Børre Meinseth had their breakthrough in the 1985 season, but Hødd were relegated in 1987 and were playing at the third tier in 1988 and finished behind the local team Hareid before Hødd won promotion to the second tier the next season.\r\n\r\nHødd reached the quarter-final of the 1994, where they lost 3–5 after extra time against Lyn, and won the 1994 Norwegian First Division and was promoted to Tippeligaen with Erik Brakstad as head coach. Hødd eliminating the defending Norwegian Cup winners Molde in the fourth round of the 1995 Norwegian Football Cup with 2–0 at home after goals from Tommy Sylte. The team went on to reach the semi-final where they lost 7–1 on aggregate against Rosenborg after losing 5–0 in the first leg at home. The team was however relegated after only one season, as they finished 12th in the 1995 Tippeligaen. With the exception of 2000, Hødd played in the First Division until 2006 when the club was relegated to the Second Division, and is the club with the most seasons at the second tier since 1963. Hødd hired Sture Fladmark, who won Tippeligaen coach of the year in 2002, as the new head coach ahead of the 2007 season, to win promotion back to the First Division. Hødd won promotion to the First Division in 2007, and started the 2008 season with a win against Sarpsborg Sparta before the team collected six points in the next 16 matches. With nine points and seven losses in a row Hødd fired Fladmark in August 2008.\r\n\r\nEinar Magne Skede and Lars Arne Nilsen replaced Fladmark, but could not prevent the team from relegation. Skede and Nilsen continued as head coaches in 2009, when Hødd finished third in the Second Division, before Nilsen continued as the sole head coach in 2010 when the team won promotion to the First Division. The newly promoted team impressed in the 2011 season, and managed to go 29 matches without losing until they lost away against Sandefjord on 22 May 2011. Hødd was positioned at second place half-way through the season, before finishing the season at eighth place.\r\n\r\nThe next season did not start as good, and after eight matches Hødd had three points with 21 conceded goals, before they went unbeaten for the next six league-games. Hødd remained in the relegation-zone throughout the season and avoided relegation with better goal difference then Tromsdalen.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Hødd won its first Norwegian Football Cup. The feat was according to pundit Arne Scheie the biggest upset in the history of the Norwegian cup, as Hødd was a second-tier team who had in fact been fighting against relegation up until the last round in the league. Despite their troubles in Adeccoligaen, Hødd defeated the first-tier teams Haugesund and Brann, qualifying them to their first ever cup final. Their opponent in the final was Tromsø, who finished fourth in Tippeligaen. After regular time, the score was 1–1, and no goals were scored in extra time. In the penalty shoot-out, Hødd won 4–2. Ørjan Nyland was named man of the match, while Fredrik Aursnes became the youngest ever Norwegian Cup winner aged 16 years and 351 days.\r\n\r\nHødd failed to defend the Norwegian Cup title, as the team was eliminated by the defending Tippeligaen winners Molde in the third round of the 2013 Norwegian Football Cup, after a penalty shoot-out where Hødd's former goalkeeper Ørjan Nyland, who had transferred to Molde after the previous season, saved two penalties. As a result of the Norwegian Cup win, Hødd qualified for the first time in a European competition, Europa League. They debuted with a 1–0 victory at home against Aktobe, but the European adventure ended after a 2–0 loss in the second leg.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Lyn 1896 Fotballklubb is a Norwegian football club and a department of the sports club Ski- og Fotballklubben Lyn based in Oslo, whose members also participate in Nordic skiing and orienteering. Until 2010, SFK Lyn had two football departments, one professional section and one amateur section. After the professional football department, FK Lyn was bankrupted in 2010, the fans decided to support the amateur department, Lyn Fotball, instead. With the help of some of the old FK Lyn players, Lyn Fotball have won three consecutive promotions, and are playing in the 3. divisjon. The team plays its home matches at Bislett Stadium, and the head coach is currently Bent Inge Johnsen.\r\n\r\nLyn was founded in 1896 and is one of the oldest football clubs in Norway, and they were founding members of the Football Association of Norway in 1902. The club won the top division title in 1964 and 1968 and have won the cup eight times. Lyn was also the initiator of the construction of Ullevaal Stadion, which has served as Norway's national stadium since 1927 and was Lyn's home ground from 1926 to 2010. Lyn has traditionally been perceived as representing the upper and middle classes, whereas the eastside club Vålerenga was seen as belonging to the workers.\r\n\r\nThe club enjoyed some success during the first half of the 20th century, securing many Cup titles, and despite failing to win the league title, had a certain stature in Norwegian football. The Norway national football team that won the bronze medal at the 1936 Summer Olympics included six players from Lyn. The captain of this team was Lyn-player Jørgen Juve, who is still the player with the most goals scored for the Norway national team. The club's most recent period of success was during the 1960s, when they won four trophies and reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup.\r\n\r\nLyn also fields a women's team, which in 2012 won promotion to the 1. divisjon, the second tier in women's football. In 2017 the women's team, managed by Glenn Kleven, won promotion to the Toppserien, the top tier of women's football in Norway.",

The club was founded on 19 September 1905. The club's current head coach is Jóhannes Harðarson. The team plays in yellow jerseys, black shorts and socks at home, and black jerseys, yellow shorts and socks away.\r\n\r\nThey play their home matches at Sør Arena, the club's own football stadium, opened in 2007. Before moving to Sør Arena, IK Start played their games at Kristiansand Stadion. The team's official supporter club was called \"Tigerberget\", until 2017, when the IK Start board decided to no longer have an official supporter club.\r\n\r\nStart's style of playing is often described as 'makrellfotball' (mackerel football), meaning the whole team is in constant, coordinated motion. Another feature of their playing style is the so-called 'Start-vippen' (Start-tip), where the ball at a free-kick is tipped up by one player before hit by another.",
