            "strDescriptionEN": "Arna-Bjørnar Fotball is a Norwegian football club from Arna, Bergen.\r\n\r\nIt was founded in late 2000 as a merger between the football branches from IL Bjørnar and Arna T&IL, and replaced Bjørnar IL in the league system from 2001. The women's team has played since then in the Toppserien apart from the 2005 season when it was in the First divisjon.\r\n\r\nProminent members of the women's team (2009) are goalkeepers Reidun Seth and Erika Skarbø, and Nigerian keeper Precious Dede brought in to cover while Skarbø recovers from a long-term wrist injury. Arna-Bjørnar has earned a reputation for developing young players and the squad includes the former and current Norway Under-19 captains, Maren Mjelde and Kristine Hegland, and prominent former Under-19 players Caroline Walde and Ingrid Ryland, both now Under-23 players, as well as senior international Madeleine Giske who played in the FIFA Women's World Cup 2007. The team has players in Norway's Under-17 team also.\r\n\r\nArna-Bjørnar's women's team is trained by Morten Kalvenes, brother of former Burnley player Christian Kalvenes.\r\n\r\nIn February 2011 the club had 13 players selected for Norway's international teams at senior level, Under-23, Under-19 and Under-17.\r\n\r\nThe men's team currently plays in the 3. divisjon, and reached the second round of the Norwegian Football Cup in 2012, when they lost 1–0 to Hødd who won the cup that season.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Røa IL is a Norwegian sports club from Røa in the borough of Vestre Aker, Oslo. It was founded on 11 November 1900, and has sections for football, gymnastics, bandy, and cross-country skiing. Football, bandy, and Nordic skiing have been dominant in Røa. In bandy, the team has twice made it to the finals in the Norwegian cup, losing both to arch-rivals Stabæk. In skiing, the two foremost names are Olav Hansson, world champion team large hill ski jumping in the 1982 World Ski Championships and Martin Johnsrud Sundby, a Norwegian national team cross-country skier who won the FIS Cross-Country World Cup and the Tour de Ski in 2013–14.\r\n\r\nThe biggest success so far is probably the women's football team. While Røa was open for women participating in handball and gymnastics, football was frowned upon for quite some time. Women's football was started outside the club by Røa legend Ole Bjørn Edner and his daughter Kristine with friends. The team was finally recognized when they started winning the Norway Cup in 1993. The team started in the fourth tier in 1994, and spent two years in each tier before they qualified for the first tier, Toppserien, in 2000. As the bandy team were relegated the same season, the football team took over as the main success. In an attempt to brand the team, a former bandy player came up with the nickname \"Dynamite Girls\", which has stuck since.\r\n\r\nRøa's first season in Toppserien was a fierce battle to avoid relegation. In the last match the team saw it through. The next two seasons were a dramatic improvement, the team finished fourth (out of ten) both times. In 2004 Røa won both league and cup. After an abysmal 2005 season, they continued their dominance with a cup victory in 2006, a league victory in 2007, and a Double in 2008 and 2009. With in all eight trophies, Røa is the third most successful team in women's football in Norway (joint with Sprint-Jeløy if one counts the proto-national league from 1984.1986).\r\n\r\nThe team has a host of current and former national team players. Among them are the 2007 World Cup players Siri Nordby (captain), Guro Knutsen Mienna, Lene Mykjåland, Marie Knutsen and Marit Fiane Christensen.\r\n\r\nThe men's football team currently plays in the Third Division (fourth tier).",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Stabæk Fotball Kvinner is Stabæk IF's women's football team, started on 23 October 2008 with a core of players from Asker. Asker had lost its licence to play in the top league after a failure to meet financial targets, and Stabæk's chairman Mimi Berdal arranged for the new team to be formed within Stabæk IF. The team was immediately joined by other players including Solveig Gulbrandsen.\r\n\r\nStabæk plays in the Toppserien, the top women's league in Norway. The new team set an attendance record in its first match, with 1,321 spectators watching a 2–0 win over Røa, and these two teams have dominated the Norwegian league and cup competitions since then.\r\n\r\nStabæk won the league championship in 2010 and thus qualified for the 2011–12 UEFA Women's Champions League to debut in Europe. The team also finished in second place to Røa in the Toppserien in 2009 and 2011, and in November 2011 won the Norwegian Cup Final.\r\n\r\nThe team played in the Champions League for the first time in 2011. They met FFC Frankfurt in their first tie and beat them 1–0 in the home match at Nadderud Stadium, Oslo, but lost the return match in Frankfurt 4-1 a week later. They were also qualified to play in the Champions League again in 2012.\r\n\r\nNotable former players in the team include Lise Klaveness, Ingrid Hjelmseth, Trine B. Rønning, and the national team captains of Norway and Denmark, Ingvild Stensland and Katrine Pedersen. Ada Hegerberg, the first ever recipient of the Ballon d'Or Féminin in 2018, played for Stabæk in 2012.",
