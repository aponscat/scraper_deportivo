Founded on 19 June 1911, Molde was originally known as International. Molde are three-time league champions (2011, 2012, 2014) and four-time Norwegian Cup winners (1994, 2005, 2013, 2014), and have finished 2nd in the league a further seven times. Molde is one of only two Norwegian clubs to have participated in the UEFA Champions League.\r\n\r\nIts home matches are played at Aker Stadion, which has a maximum capacity of 11,800. The stadium was inaugurated in 1998, and was a gift from the local businessmen Kjell Inge Røkke and Bjørn Rune Gjelsten. The club was formerly based at Molde stadion, which hosted the club's record attendance of 14,615. Molde's supporter club is called Tornekrattet (\"Thorn bush\", a reference to the city's nickname \"The Town of Roses\") and were started after the 1994 Cup Final victory.\r\n\r\nUntil the beginning of the 1970s, the club mainly played in local lower division leagues, except for a short visit in the Hovedserien in the 1957–58 season. In 1974 Molde was back in the top division and finished second in the league, and have since then become one of Norway's leading clubs and generally stayed in the top division. Molde also finished second in the league in 1987, when the club lost the championship to Moss in the decisive match of the season.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s, Molde was the second best team in Norway (behind 13-times in a row champions Rosenborg), with league silver medals in 1995, 1998, 1999 and 2002 and cup championship in 1994 and 2005, and the participation in the Champions League in the 1999–2000 season, when Real Madrid, Porto and Olympiacos visited Molde.\r\n\r\nThe club was the first professional club of former Manchester United player Ole Gunnar Solskjær, and in January 2011 he returned to manage the club. In his first season as manager, which also was the club's centenary season, Molde won the league championship for the first time. The next season Solskjær and Molde retained the championship. Today the club has approximately 900 members and around 55 teams in three departments.",

Rosenborg is Norway's most successful team, having won 23 league titles, nine Norwegian Football Cup titles and played more UEFA matches than any other Norwegian team. RBK play their home games at the all-seater Lerkendal Stadion which has a capacity of 21,400. Kåre Ingebrigtsen was appointed head coach in July 2014.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded as Odd in 1917 but were not allowed to play amateur league matches until 1928, when they took the present name. They reached the League of Norway in 1937–38, but were relegated to lower divisions during the 1940s. The club moved to Lerkendal in 1957 and their first title was the 1960 Cup, resulting in their first participation in a UEFA tournament. It was not until the 1960s that RBK was established as Trondheim's leading football team. In 1967 RBK was promoted to the top league where they, except for the 1978 season, have remained ever since. They won three league titles between 1967 and 1971. The club's golden era started with the 1985 league title. From 1991 through 2004 the team won 13 consecutive titles, 10 under manager Nils Arne Eggen. During this period they also participated in the group stage of Champions League 11 times, reaching the quarter-finals in 1996–97.",

It is the elite football section of the multi-sports club Strømsgodset IF.\r\n\r\nThe multi-sports club was founded 10 February 1907, but the football team first found success in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Led by the young striker Steinar Pettersen and his team-mates, the «Rødgata Boys» (nicknamed after the street most of them lived on), Strømsgodset got promoted from the fourth tier to the top flight in just a few years. The team then went on to win Tippeligaen in 1970 and the Norwegian Cup in 1969, 1970, 1973.\r\n\r\nIn the following decades, the club struggled more. However, the relegation to the third tier in 1986 was a turning point for the football team, and the club was promoted to the top flight again in 1989. In 1991, the club secured its fourth Norwegian Cup, and a turbulent decade followed, with promotions and relegations. In 1997 they lost the cup final, but secured bronze medals in the league.\r\n\r\nAfter five years in the second tier, the economical situation had become a problem for the club, bringing it almost to bankruptcy in 2005. However, local investors saved the club, and this was the start of the second successful period. The club was promoted to Tippeligaen, won the Norwegian cup in 2010, and gradually grew into one of the best teams in Norway. A 2nd place in 2012 was followed by another championship in 2013, the club's second league title.",
