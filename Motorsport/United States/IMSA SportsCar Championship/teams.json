            "strDescriptionEN": "Action Express Racing (AXR) is a sports car racing team that currently competes in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. The team is owned by Bob Johnson and run by former NASCAR champion crew chief Gary Nelson. Based in Denver, North Carolina, the team currently fields the No. 5 Cadillac DPi-V.R for João Barbosa and Filipe Albuquerque under the banner of Mustang Sampling Racing, as well as the No. 31 Whelen Engineering Racing Cadillac DPi-V.R for Felipe Nasr and Pipo Derani.\r\n\r\nThe team is the most successful in the current era of US sports car racing, having won four out of the first five WeatherTech Sports Car Championships in the premier Prototype class. Victories in 2014 and 2015 by the No. 5 was followed by the No. 31 capturing the title in 2016 and 2018. In addition, the team has won every North American Endurance Cup since the format began.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nRolex Sports Car Series\r\nAction Express Racing was founded in 2010 and ran in the former Rolex Sports Car Series. The team started out of the gate strong, by winning the 2010 Rolex 24 at Daytona. Their lineup in the No. 5 Riley Mk. XI featured João Barbosa, Terry Borcheller, Ryan Dalziel, and Audi LMP1 driver Mike Rockenfeller. The team's win was notable as their engine, a Porsche 5.0L V8 engine, was not sanctioned by Porsche itself, and was built by a third party based on the Porsche Cayenne. Full season drivers Barbosa and Borcheller were joined by J. C. France for a few rounds, but did not find the podium again, finishing 13th in points. Barbosa, Borcheller, and France reunited the following season, taking a podium at the 2011 Rolex 24 and winning at Virginia International Raceway, enough for Barbosa and France to finish 5th in points. The team also expanded to the No. 9 Riley-Porsche, driven by Darren Law, IndyCar driver Buddy Rice, David Donohue, and Burt Frissele. After reuniting Barbosa and France, the team opted to replace the latter with Law, scoring wins at Belle Isle and the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen.\r\n\r\nFor 2013, AXR fielded both the Nos. 5 and 9, this time as Corvette Daytona Prototypes. They were driven by Christian Fittipaldi, Brian Frissele, Barbosa and Burt Frissele, respectively. The team opted to join Barbosa and Fittipaldi together for the remained of the season after Road Atlanta, and the pair would score two wins at Mid-Ohio and Watkins Glen. While the Frissele brothers were teamed up, they only scored a single podium at Road America.\r\n\r\nIMSA SportsCar Championship\r\nThree straight championships (2014-2016)\r\nFor the newly formed IMSA SportsCar championship in 2014, AXR ran only the No. 5 of Barbosa and Fittipaldi for the full season, reducing the No. 9 crewed by the Frissele brothers and Jon Fogarty to only the North American Endurance Cup. AXR took three wins, including the team's second Rolex 24, en route to both the inaugural title and North American Endurance Cup for the No. 5. For 2015, AXR assumed operations of the No. 31 Whelen Racing team, hiring GTD champion Dane Cameron to pair with Eric Curran. The No. 5 took its second IMSA title as well as the NAEC on the back of two wins including the 12 Hours of Sebring and Petit Le Mans, while the No. 31 team won at Detroit and Road America to finish 3rd in points.\r\n\r\nThe No. 5 and No. 31 remained unchanged in 2016. With their worst finish being 6th and two wins at Canadian Tire Motorsports Park and Road America, the No. 31 Corvette team won the drivers title, with the No. 5 team taking home another North American Endurance Cup.\r\n\r\nCadillac DPi-V.R (2017-present)\r\nFrom 2017, both Mustang Sampling Racing and Whelen Engineering Racing fielded Dallara-based Cadillac DPi-V.R machines. The Rolex 24 At Daytona saw the Mustang Sampling Cadillac knocked from the lead on the penultimate lap by Wayne Taylor Racing, another Cadillac team. Following the Daytona outing near-miss, the team continued to learn the new Cadillac Prototype as the No. 10 team had a strong start to the season. Mustang Sampling Racing returned to the winner circle at Watkins Glen and began to gain momentum. Even with both cars taking wins, compared to the last three seasons, had a relatively disappointing year, the Nos. 5 and 31 only winning one race each, and watched the rival Wayne Taylor Cadillac win the first five races on their way to the WeatherTech Championship, however the No. 5 would once again take the NAEC, their fourth in a row.\r\n\r\n2018 would bring changes to the team. Christian Fittipaldi would move to an endurance driver\/manager role in the team, while Dane Cameron would leave to join Team Penske's new Acura program. Their spots on the team would be filled by Filipe Albuquerque and ex-F1 driver Felipe Nasr, respectively. The team started the 2018 season with a 1-2 finish at the Rolex 24, setting an all-time distance record. The Mustang Sampling car then won at Long Beach, with the Whelen Engineering Racing squad taking a victory at Detroit, and eventually capturing both the WSCC and NAEC for 2018.\r\n\r\nFor 2019, the Pipo Derani joins the team in the No. 31 from Extreme Speed Motorsports, filling a void left by Eric Curran's move to endurance driver role. Additionally, Christian Fittipaldi will leave the driver's seat as he finishes his transition to a management role following the 2019 Rolex 24 at Daytona.",

In stock car racing, the team was known for competing in the NASCAR Xfinity Series and the K&N Pro Series East. The team is owned by Rick Gdovic and was formed from the assets of Viva Motorsports. After the 2017 season, PPM shuttered its stock car operation to transition to sports car racing. \r\nThe team announced in early December 2017 that it would be suspending its NASCAR operations and moving into the Continental Tire SportsCar Challenge and posted the sale of its Xfinity Series equipment. Later, team owner Rick Gdovic said that his son Brandon Gdovic wanted to move to sports car racing, and that the financial model in that discipline is better than stock car racing. Rick had tried to sell the team before the 2017 season began but an investment group set to buy the team fell through. In 2018, the team fielded two entries in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo North America series before expanding to the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship for 2019.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "TR3 Racing is an American sports car racing team that currently competes in the GT World Challenge America, fielding a Mercedes-AMG GT3 Evo.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nLamborghini Huracán Super Trofeo of Rodrigo Vales and Rogelio Perusquia at Watkins Glen in 2022.\r\nTR3 Racing was founded in 2015 as the motorsports arm of TR3 Performance, an aftermarket tuning operation based out of South Florida.\r\n\r\nGT World Challenge America\r\nIn 2017, the team began competing in the Pirelli World Challenge, fielding a Ferrari 488 GT3 for Daniel Mancinelli. Entering the Pro class, Mancinelli was paired with co-drivers Andrea Montermini and Niccolò Schirò for the SprintX events. Claiming three victories and five overall podiums, Mancinelli finished fourth in the overall GT-class championship. TR3 returned in 2018, alternating their Sprint and SprintX lineups. Wei Lu and Jeff Segal piloted the team's Ferrari in the longer SprintX events, while Mancinelli continued in his solo-driver duties for the other half of the season. However, Mancinelli would miss the opening round at St. Petersburg, as the team withdrew citing unfavorable BoP. TR3 had entered the updated 2018 model, which received a 20 kilogram weight increase over the 2017 edition of the 488 GT3. Although team principal Gregory Romanelli threatened to pull the entry from additional events later in the year, both TR3 cars completed the entire 2018 season in their respective championships. Mancinelli's one win, at Long Beach, and four podiums were the team's only podium finishes of the season. TR3 also began collaborating with Squadra Corse Garage Italia, as the latter's driver lineup of Caesar Bacarella and Martin Fuentes claimed the GTA class championship in both Sprint and SprintX competition.\r\n\r\nFor 2019, the team continued their partnership with Squadra Corse Garage Italia, fielding a pair of entries in the rebranded GT World Challenge America. The TR3-branded entry secured one class victory in the four races it entered, taking the Pro-Am Cup victory in the first race at Circuit of the Americas. The Squadra Corse-branded entry, piloted by Martin Fuentes, claimed the Am-class title.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, the team shifted to competing with Mercedes-AMG machinery in the series. The program's early stages were primarily led by Mercedes-affiliated driver Daniel Morad, who competed alongside gentleman driver Ziad Ghandour. As the team was switching from the mid-engine Lamborghini Huracán GT3 to the front-engine Mercedes-AMG GT3, Morad described preparations for the opening weekend at Sonoma as a \"crash course\" for the operation, with few similarities to draw between the two cars.\r\n\r\nIMSA SportsCar Championship\r\nFor the 2022 24 Hours of Daytona, TR3 fielded Lamborghini's sole GTD Pro-class entry, receiving full factory support from the Italian marque. The #63 entry was piloted by Mirko Bortolotti, Andrea Caldarelli, Marco Mapelli, and Rolf Ineichen.
