The team began running part-time in 2004 as Means-Jenkins Motorsports under a partnership with Jimmy Means and restaurant entrepreneur Bob Jenkins, with Jenkins becoming the full team owner in 2005. The team currently fields the No. 34 Love's Travel Stops\/CSX – Play it Safe\/Dockside Logistics\/A&W All American Food Ford Fusion full-time for Chris Buescher, the No. 35 Shaw's Southern Belle Seafood Ford Fusion part-time for David Gilliland, and No. 38 Florida Lottery\/FR8 Auctions\/MDS Transport\/Snap Fitness\/The Pete Store Ford Fusion full-time for Landon Cassill.\r\n\r\nFront Row has become known as one of the more prominent small-budget teams in the Cup Series, operating with around 60 employees on a fraction of the budget of larger teams, and with equipment often coming second-hand from other Ford teams such as Roush-Fenway Racing. The team has struggled on most intermediate tracks, however since 2011, the team has become noted for its performance at superspeedways and to a lesser extent short tracks, which rely less on aerodynamic performance. This reputation has grown since the signing of noted restrictor plate racer David Ragan in 2012, who won the team's first race at Talladega the next year with the help of another skilled plate racer David Gilliland.\r\n\r\nThe team has received equipment from Roush Fenway Racing since 2010, and began a technical alliance with Roush in 2016. The team also began receiving technical support from Ford starting in 2016, after receiving limited data from Ford since 2010.",

The team fields the No. 47 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 full-time for Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and has a technical alliance with Hendrick Motorsports.\r\nThe team was founded in 1995 as ST Racing by advertising executive Tad Geschickter and crew chief Steve Plattenberger, competing in the Busch Grand National Series (now the NASCAR Xfinity Series). In 2006, the team rebranded to JTG Racing under the ownership of Geschickter and his wife Jodi, and began competing in the Cup Series, initially as a co-entry with Wood Brothers Racing. Former NBA All-Star center Brad Daugherty joined the ownership group in 2008 to form JTG Daugherty Racing. Under this name, the team would begin competing as an independent organization in 2009, score their first Cup Series win in 2014 with driver A. J. Allmendinger, and win the 2023 Daytona 500 with Stenhouse. Other notable drivers to compete for the team during this period include Marcos Ambrose, Bobby Labonte, and Chris Buescher.\r\nBefore or during the 2024 season, the Geschickters quietly left the team, moving into a role at Joe Gibbs Racing. Entrepreneur Gordon Smith would become principal owner thereafter and rebranded the team to Hyak Motorsports for the 2025 season; Daugherty, Mark Hughes and Ernie Cope completed the ownership group at that time. The name \"Hyak\" means \"fast\" in Chinook Jargon, and is also in reference to Smith's marine transportation company Hyak Maritime.[",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Joe Gibbs Racing (JGR) is an American professional stock car racing team owned and operated by former Washington Redskins coach Joe Gibbs, who first started racing on the NASCAR circuit in 1991, and J. D. Gibbs, his son. Headquartered in Huntersville, North Carolina, roughly 10 miles (16 km) northwest of Charlotte Motor Speedway, the team has amassed four Sprint Cup championships since the year 2000. For the team's first sixteen seasons, JGR ran cars from General Motors. During that period, the team won their three championships, two in Pontiac Grand Prixes and one in a Chevrolet Monte Carlo. Despite this, Joe Gibbs Racing announced during the 2007 season that they would be ending their arrangement with GM at the end of the year and begin running Toyotas the following season. This partnership would eventually bring Toyota their first Sprint Cup when Kyle Busch won the championship in 2015.\r\n\r\nIn the Sprint Cup Series, the team currently fields the No. 11 FedEx\/Sport Clips Toyota Camry full-time for Denny Hamlin, the No. 18 M&M's\/Interstate Batteries Toyota Camry full-time for Kyle Busch, the No. 19 ARRIS Toyota Camry full-time for Carl Edwards, and the No. 20 Dollar General\/DeWalt Toyota Camry full-time for Matt Kenseth. In the Xfinity Series, the team currently fields the No. 18 NOS Energy Drink Toyota Camry full-time for part-time drivers Bobby Labonte, Kyle Busch, Matt Tifft, Denny Hamlin, the No. 19 ARRIS\/Juniper Networks\/Interstate Batteries Toyota Camry full-time for Daniel Suárez, and the No. 20 Reser's Fine Foods\/Hisense\/Interstate Batteries\/Gamestop Toyota Camry full-time for Erik Jones.\r\n\r\nThe team also has a strong development program for up and coming drivers, grooming future Sprint Cup Winners Joey Logano and Aric Almirola and winning one championship in the East Division of the NASCAR Camping World Series (now K&N Pro Series) with Logano. The organization teamed up with former NFL player Reggie White in 2004 to create a diversity program, fielding drivers such as Almirola, Marc Davis, and Darrell Wallace, Jr., and forming the basis for NASCAR's own Drive for Diversity program. Currently Erik Jones, Daniel Suárez, Cody Coughlin, and Matt Tifft are under development contracts, driving in the Xfinity Series for JGR and the Camping World Truck Series for Kyle Busch Motorsports.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Wood Brothers Racing is an American professional stock car racing team that currently competes in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. The team was formed in 1950 by Glen and Leonard Wood, hence the \"Wood Brothers\". The Wood Brothers merged with Tad and Jodi Geschickter's JTG Racing in 2006 to increase their competitiveness and bring about sponsorship but separated for the 2008 season. The Wood Brothers Racing Team holds the unique distinction of being the oldest active team in NASCAR, having fielded cars since 1950. They are known for their long relationship with Ford Motor Company, and the long-standing use of number 21 on their main car. The team currently fields the No. 21 Ford Mustang full-time for Paul Menard.",
