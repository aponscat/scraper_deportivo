            "strDescriptionEN": "The Flying Lizard Motorsports group is a motorsport team from Sonoma, California, formed by Seth Neiman in early 2003. The team competed in the full American Le Mans Series season, as well as the 24 Hours of Daytona, and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The team went on to win six driver and team championships in the American Le Mans Series, becoming a Porsche factory team and Porsche Motorsport North America's development partner from 2007 to 2012. The team helped develop the first- and second-generation 997 GT3 RSR as well as bring it to victory several times in its six-year run in the series. The team solely raced Porsche cars from 2004 to 2019, becoming a staple in the Porsche racing community.\r\n\r\nAfter ten years of ownership, Seth Neiman sold the team during the 2014 offseason to longtime Crew Chief Tommy Sadler, Chief Strategist Thomas Blam, and current Lizard driver Dylan Breen. Sadler stepped up to become Technical Director, Blam became Team Manager and Law Program Manager. No longer factory-backed or privately funded, the team became a customer racing effort, expanding to a variety of series and manufacturers.\r\n\r\nTo date, the team holds 14 professional team and driver championship titles as Flying Lizard Motorsport, four additional team and two driver titles managing K-PAX Racing in GT World Challenge America, and one team and one driver title managing TKO Motorsports.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Precision Performance Motorsports (PPM) is an American professional sports car racing and former stock car racing team that currently competes full-time in the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship using a GT Daytona-class Lamborghini Huracán GT3 Evo. In stock car racing, the team was known for competing in the NASCAR Xfinity Series and the K&N Pro Series East. The team is owned by Rick Gdovic and was formed from the assets of Viva Motorsports. After the 2017 season, PPM shuttered its stock car operation to transition to sports car racing. \r\nThe team announced in early December 2017 that it would be suspending its NASCAR operations and moving into the Continental Tire SportsCar Challenge and posted the sale of its Xfinity Series equipment. Later, team owner Rick Gdovic said that his son Brandon Gdovic wanted to move to sports car racing, and that the financial model in that discipline is better than stock car racing. Rick had tried to sell the team before the 2017 season began but an investment group set to buy the team fell through. In 2018, the team fielded two entries in the Lamborghini Super Trofeo North America series before expanding to the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship for 2019.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "TR3 Racing is an American sports car racing team that currently competes in the GT World Challenge America, fielding a Mercedes-AMG GT3 Evo.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nLamborghini Huracán Super Trofeo of Rodrigo Vales and Rogelio Perusquia at Watkins Glen in 2022.\r\nTR3 Racing was founded in 2015 as the motorsports arm of TR3 Performance, an aftermarket tuning operation based out of South Florida.\r\n\r\nGT World Challenge America\r\nIn 2017, the team began competing in the Pirelli World Challenge, fielding a Ferrari 488 GT3 for Daniel Mancinelli. Entering the Pro class, Mancinelli was paired with co-drivers Andrea Montermini and Niccolò Schirò for the SprintX events. Claiming three victories and five overall podiums, Mancinelli finished fourth in the overall GT-class championship. TR3 returned in 2018, alternating their Sprint and SprintX lineups. Wei Lu and Jeff Segal piloted the team's Ferrari in the longer SprintX events, while Mancinelli continued in his solo-driver duties for the other half of the season. However, Mancinelli would miss the opening round at St. Petersburg, as the team withdrew citing unfavorable BoP. TR3 had entered the updated 2018 model, which received a 20 kilogram weight increase over the 2017 edition of the 488 GT3. Although team principal Gregory Romanelli threatened to pull the entry from additional events later in the year, both TR3 cars completed the entire 2018 season in their respective championships. Mancinelli's one win, at Long Beach, and four podiums were the team's only podium finishes of the season. TR3 also began collaborating with Squadra Corse Garage Italia, as the latter's driver lineup of Caesar Bacarella and Martin Fuentes claimed the GTA class championship in both Sprint and SprintX competition.\r\n\r\nFor 2019, the team continued their partnership with Squadra Corse Garage Italia, fielding a pair of entries in the rebranded GT World Challenge America. The TR3-branded entry secured one class victory in the four races it entered, taking the Pro-Am Cup victory in the first race at Circuit of the Americas. The Squadra Corse-branded entry, piloted by Martin Fuentes, claimed the Am-class title.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, the team shifted to competing with Mercedes-AMG machinery in the series. The program's early stages were primarily led by Mercedes-affiliated driver Daniel Morad, who competed alongside gentleman driver Ziad Ghandour. As the team was switching from the mid-engine Lamborghini Huracán GT3 to the front-engine Mercedes-AMG GT3, Morad described preparations for the opening weekend at Sonoma as a \"crash course\" for the operation, with few similarities to draw between the two cars.\r\n\r\nIMSA SportsCar Championship\r\nFor the 2022 24 Hours of Daytona, TR3 fielded Lamborghini's sole GTD Pro-class entry, receiving full factory support from the Italian marque. The #63 entry was piloted by Mirko Bortolotti, Andrea Caldarelli, Marco Mapelli, and Rolf Ineichen. The entry would take pole through a class victory in the 100-minute qualifying race, but would retire from the 24-hour event and finish 12th in GTD Pro. The team would return to the GTD Pro class for the 2022 12 Hours of Sebring, finishing second in class.",
