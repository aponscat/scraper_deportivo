They have also competed in the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour. \r\nThe team fielded the No. 22 full-time for Tommy Barrett Jr. in the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour in 2014. The following year, they attempted to make their debut in the ARCA Racing Series at Daytona with Barrett Jr. driving the No. 7 car, but he did not end up qualifying for the race. It was the only ARCA race the team attempted that year.\r\nIn 2016, they returned to ARCA at Talladega with the No. 02 Chevrolet driven by defending NASCAR Whelen Southern Modified Tour champion Andy Seuss. The team had a great qualifying run, starting 10th, but encountered a failure in the brake system and finished 31st. They did not run any other races until Daytona in 2017, where Seuss returned to drive the No. 02 and finished 20th. They returned to Talladega a few months later and impressively, Seuss came from a 33rd-place starting position to finish 2nd in the race. They then attempted the race at Chicagoland in September, the team's first ever non-restrictor plate start in ARCA.",
