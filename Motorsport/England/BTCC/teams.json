In addition to constructing over 75 of the high-powered CHALLENGE JCW race cars for both the UK and overseas markets, the Norfolk-based outfit also fields multiple drivers across the three classes of the British series.\r\nHaving enjoyed its most successful campaign to date in 2020, which included a podium for the brand-new machinery during the season opener at Brands Hatch, EXCELR8 Motorsport joined forces with Trade Price Cars Racing ahead of the 2021 campaign.\r\nThe 2022 season sees the two sister teams form a four-car outfit, with Tom Ingram and Jack Butel joined by BTCC race winners Tom Chilton and Dan Lloyd to pilot the quartet of Hyundai i30Ns, and the squad enter the Manufacturers’\/Constructors’ battle for the first time.",

The team has raced in the British Touring Car Championship, since 2015 after purchasing BTC Racing in February 2015.\r\nAfter having purchased BTC Racing in February 2015, the team entered the 2015 British Touring Car Championship season with Dave Newsham and Josh Cook driving an NGTC Chevrolet Cruze each. The last season with the Chevrolet Cruze saw Emmerdale star Kelvin Fletcher take the wheel. Fletcher did not have a very successful season and was dropped from the team.\r\nOn 22 November 2016 Power Maxed Racing announced that Vauxhall would be returning to BTCC with the Astra for the 2017 season.\r\nThe 2017 drivers were Tom Chilton and Senna Proctor. Senna secured victory in the prestigious Jack Sears Trophy, awarded to best rookie, with an unprecedented 5 rounds of the season left to run. The car earned a number of podiums under Tom Chilton and guest driver, WTCC Champion Rob Huff.\r\n2018 saw 2015 Jack Sears Champion Josh Cook return to PMR alongside Proctor. Proctor would take both his and the team's first win in the second race at Brands Hatch, after gambling with slick tyres on a drying track. This was followed up by Cook taking the team's first pole position three weeks later at Donington Park, before converting it into his first win in race 1. Cook would go on to take another win in Race 2 at Thruxton , while Proctor would take 2 more podiums throughout the rest of the season. Cook finished the season in 6th with 246 points, with Proctor in 12th with 170 points to round out the team's best year in the sport.\r\nFor the 2022 campaign, CarStore Power Maxed Racing’s BTCC line-up sees fan favourite Michael Crees make his series return alongside Ash Hand as he makes his debut in Britain’s premier motorsport series.",
