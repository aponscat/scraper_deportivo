            "strDescriptionEN": "AUTOBACS Racing Team AGURI (ARTA) is a joint racing project formed between former F1 driver Aguri Suzuki and Autobacs Seven Co. in 1997. The team's original name was \"ARTA F1 Project,\" but due to trademark claims based on the usage of the word \"F1\", the name has since been shortened to \"ARTA\". ARTA was the 2007 SuperGT GT500 series champion in both the drivers' and team championship.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nThe team was created with the objective of developing drivers that could compete in the highest levels of F1 racing. In addition to competing in racing competitions such as Formula Nippon and Super GT, the team also holds its youth kart racing competition, the \"ARTA Challenge,\" to find the next generation of competitive race drivers.\r\n\r\nToshihiro Kaneishi, a driver who received support from ARTA, won the German Formula Three Championship in 2001.\r\n\r\nAs of 2007, the team competed in, or offered support to other drivers who competed in the following categories:\r\n\r\nFormula Nippon\r\nSuper GT\r\nIndy Racing League\r\nAll-Japan Formula Three Championship\r\nFormula Challenge Japan\r\nKarting World Championship\r\nThe team maintained a close relationship with Aguri Suzuki's F1 team, Super Aguri F1, before they were forced to withdraw from Formula One in 2008. ARTA is currently the largest racing team in Japan.\r\n\r\nSuper GT\r\nGT500\r\n\r\nARTA's Honda NSX which competed in the GT500 class of the Super GT series.\r\nThe team participated with the Nissan Skyline GT-R from 1998 to 1999. In 2000, the team joined up with Honda, and began using the Honda NSX. Owner Aguri Suzuki and Keiichi Tsuchiya drove in the first year with Honda, and Katsutomo Kaneishi replaced Aguri in 2001. In 2003, Kaneishi moved on to participate in the DTM series, and his cousin, Toshihiro Kaneishi, took over as driver. Tsuchiya also announced his retirement the same year. Katsutomo Kaneishi returned from DTM in 2004, and became driver along with Daisuke Ito. Tsuchiya became team director this year, but various mechanical failures caused the team to win only 2 points in the entire competition. In 2005, ARTA became a Honda team (Team Honda Racing), along with Takata Dome NSX. Aguri returned as team director, with Ito and Ralph Firman as drivers. The team took pole position 3 times, and was competitive all season. The team won the 7th race at Autopolis. ARTA kept the same drivers for 2006, but was unable to win the competition despite taking the pole position several times. The team did win the 4th race at Sepang. Team Honda Racing was dissolved in 2007, and ARTA participated in the competition with the same lineup as 2006. They won 3 races during the season on their way to championship victory. For 2008 Firman is joined by class newcomer Takuya Izawa while former driver Daisuke Ito left the team to drive for ENEOS TOYOTA Team LeMans.\r\n\r\nGT300\r\nThe team made its debut in 2001 with the Toyota MR-S, and became series champion in 2002 with drivers Morio Nitta and Shinichi Takagi.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, ARTA participated with the ASL Garaiya, which had been developed by Autobacs. The machine showed good cornering, but the Nissan SR engine lacked power, resulting in a poor finish. In 2004, the team switched over to the Nissan VQ engine, and won two consecutive races. However, they failed to win the competition by a margin of 1 point. In 2005, the team was leading in points at the 7th race, (Autopolis) but lost in the final race to place 3rd in the final standings. The team director had announced during the season that the team would be dissolved if they failed to become champion, leading ARTA to end its participation in the GT300 series.\r\n\r\nHowever, in 2007, Aguri Suzuki announced that he would like to race the Garaiya to commemorate the ten-year anniversary of the start of ARTA, and the team renewed its participation in the series with the same lineup as 2005. The Garaiya won the 3rd race, (Fuji Speedway) but crashed in all of the proceeding races and was forced to retire from the competition.\r\n\r\nIndy Racing League\r\nARTA first entered the Indy Racing League in 2003, backing a car driven by Japanese-American Roger Yasukawa that was prepared by Fernandez Racing. This car was called \"Super Aguri Fernandez Racing\" and Aguri Suzuki was listed as a team owner. In 2004, Yasukawa was replaced by Kosuke Matsuura, who won rookie of the year honors for both the Indianapolis 500 and the league, and finishing fourth at Kentucky. Matsuura continued with Aguri in 2005 and 2006, scoring several top 10s but no top 5s.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, ARTA and Aguri switched their support from Fernandez to Panther Racing, bringing Matsuura with them. He scored a fourth-place finish at Michigan and a fifth at Detroit. He finished no better than 13th in IndyCar Series points in his four years in the series.\r\n\r\nAlso in 2007, Aguri signed Japanese driver Hideki Mutoh to run in the Indy Pro Series developmental league. Mutoh won 2 races, finished second in Pro Series points, and made his IndyCar debut at the final race of the 2007 season, finishing 8th and recording the fastest race lap.\r\n\r\nFor 2008, Mutoh took on the Panasonic and Formula Dream sponsorship and moved to Andretti Green Racing, winning Rookie of the Year honors. However, the entry was no longer branded as an ARTA project.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Nismo (abbreviated from Nissan Motorsport International Limited (ニッサン・モータースポーツ・インターナショナル株式会社 Nissan Mōtā Supōtsu Intānashonaru Kabushiki-gaisha?)) is the in-house tuning, motorsports and performance division of Nissan. Formed in 1984 as a result of a merger of two motorsport departments, Nismo cars have participated in JSPC, JTCC, 24 Hours of Le Mans and 24 Hours of Daytona. They currently participate in the Super GT and the Blancpain GT Series, and in 2015 will compete alongside Audi, Toyota and Porsche in the FIA World Endurance Championship in the LMP1 class, with the new Nissan GT-R LM NISMO.\r\n\r\nIn 1984, Nissan decided that it wanted to merge its two motorsport divisions, founded through the 1960s, they were Oppama Works (ja) (known as Publication Division 3), based in its Oppama factory, responsible for the needs of privateer teams and Ōmori Works (ja) (Special Car Testing Division), within its Ōmori plant, responsible for its factory operations. The company's intention following the merger was to specialize in sportscar racing, but it also provided support for teams competing in the domestic F3 series.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, NISMO built its first car, the Saurus for motorsport use for its one-make series. The following year they developed the Skyline GT-R for racing as well as building the 500 evolution editions for road use.\r\n\r\nProducts include the GT-R, 370z and the Juke Nismo. Soon to be added to the range is the hatchback Nissan Pulsar Nismo.\r\n\r\nIn the 1960s, Nissan competed in the Japanese Grand Prix sports car race.\r\n\r\nNissan joined the IMSA GT Championship in 1979, where it competed in the GT classes with the 240SX, 280ZX and 300ZX. From 1985 to 1993, they entered the main GTP class with the GTP ZX-Turbo and NPT-90. Geoff Brabham won four GTP drivers championships with Nissan from 1988 to 1991, and the manufacturer won the 1992 24 Hours of Daytona and the 1989, 1990 and 1991 12 Hours of Sebring.\r\n\r\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Nissan raced at the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship and 24 Hours of Le Mans with sports prototypes such as the R88C, R89C, R90C and R391. They claimed the 1990, 1991 and 1992 JSPC titles, but they never won at Le Mans. Notable Nissan drivers in this era include Masahiro Hasemi, Kazuyoshi Hoshino, Masahiko Kageyama and Toshio Suzuki.\r\n\r\nIn the 1980s, the manufacturer entered the Fuji Grand Champion Series with Group 5 Bluebird, Skyline and Silvia silhouettes and the Japanese Touring Car Championship with production Skyline models. In the 1990s, Nissan competed in Supertouring championships around the world with the Nissan Primera, winning the 1999 British Touring Car Championship with Laurent Aiello.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Nissan entered the V8 Supercars with the Nissan Altima, partnering with Kelly Racing.\r\n\r\nNismo currently participate in the Super GT as a team, where they have won multiple GT500 championships with Érik Comas, Satoshi Motoyama, Michael Krumm, Richard Lyons, Benoît Tréluyer, Tsugio Matsuda and Ronnie Quintarelli.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nissan entered the FIA GT1 World Championship with a Nismo-developed Nissan GT-R. Krumm and Lucas Luhr were 2011 drivers champions. Since 2011, Nismo has produced the GT-R GT3, which has competed in the Blancpain Endurance Series. Nismo has also developed production class Nissan GT-R cars for the 24 Hours of Nürburgring.\r\n\r\nThey also have a pool of drivers, known as the Nismo Global Driver Exchange. This allows factory drivers the chance to race in big events such as the Le Mans 24 Hours, the 24 Hours of Dubai and the Bathurst 12 Hour.\r\n\r\nSince 2011, Nissan is involved in the FIA World Endurance Championship and European Le Mans Series as a LMP2 engine supplier. They have had success with Greaves Motorsport, Signature Team, OAK Racing, TDS Racing, G-Drive Racing and SMP Racing.\r\n\r\nFor the 2015 Le Mans 24 Hours race, Nissan announced in June 2014, that Nismo will enter the LMP1 category to fight for the FIA World Endurance Championship against Audi, Toyota and Porsche. Following a disappointing performance in the 24 Hours, the program's remaining schedule in 2015 was pushed back, with the team intending a regular rebut in the 2016 season; however on 22 December 2015, Nissan announced that it was shuttering the program altogether.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Dome Co. Ltd (株式会社童夢 Kabushiki Gaisha Dōmu), literally \"child's dream\", is a Japanese racing car constructor involved mainly in open-wheel and sports car racing.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nA Dome S101hb run by Racing for Holland at the 2006 24 Hours of Le Mans.\r\nIn 1965, Minoru Hayashi built his first racing car, a rebodied Honda S600 coupe. Belonging to Tojiro Ukiya, it was called the \"Karasu\" (crow in Japanese), due to its shape. Built on a small budget and in a short time, the Karasu emphasized weight reduction and aerodynamics using FRP materials. The car went on to win its debut race at the Suzuka Clubman Race, despite Hayashi having no experience in racecar construction. In 1966 he went on to build the \"Macransa\", a more extensively modified Honda S800, to compete at the Japanese Grand Prix. This was followed by the \"Kusabi\" three years later, which was a Formula Junior racing car, and the \"Panic\" in 1971.\r\n\r\nIn 1975 at Takaragaike, Kyoto, Hayashi formed Dome with the intention to manufacture cars with small production runs, using racing machines to develop the technology. Three years after the company's formation in 1978, the company produced its first concept car designed for road use, the Nissan L28-powered Dome Zero (童夢-零 Dōmu Zero). It made its public debut at the Geneva Motor Show the same year. For the following year, Dome produced a production version of the Zero called the Zero P2, which was exhibited at the Chicago Auto Show and Los Angeles Auto Expo. The car was refused type approval by the Japanese government, however, and was unable to go into production.\r\n\r\nDome continued as a sportscar constructor building cars for Toyota's motorsport department TOM'S to compete in the All Japan Super Silhouette Championship, then later used Group C cars at the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship, which were also used to compete in the World Sportscar Championship until the end of the decade when Dome switched to building cars for Honda.\r\n\r\nFormula Three\r\nMinoru Hayashi would also assist his cousin Masakazu Hayashi (of the Hayashi aluminum wheel company) establish his own formula car manufacturing concern. After producing cars for Japan's Formula Junior 1600 category for 10 years, their first Formula 3 car was the Hayashi 803 Formula Three car, designed by the two cousins. It was followed by the Hayashi 320 in 1981 designed by Masao Ono, who had also designed the 1976 Kojima F1 car. Osamu Nakako won the All-Japan Formula Three Championship title driving a Hayashi 320. A 320 was also modified for the Formula Atlantic category and won the Macau Grand Prix driven by American Bob Earl. A further development, the 321, saw action briefly in Japan and England. Ono then switched to Dome to work on the sportscar designs, and Hayashi Racing switched to Ralt chassis to win the Japanese F3 title with Kengo Nakamoto.\r\n\r\nIn 1984, the follow-up Hayashi 322 was a success and helped Shuji Hyodo to win that year's Japanese F3 championship. In 1985, the Hayashi 330 won a single Japanese F3 race, but finishes were good enough to place driver Shuji Hyodo third in season-end standing. A development of the 322, the 331, appeared in a handful of Japanese F3 races in 1986 without success and disappeared quietly. A downturn in the aluminum wheel business is credited in causing Hayashi to abandon racing.\r\n\r\nPost-Formula Three\r\nIn 1988, Dome would return to production car design, establishing a design studio called Jiotto Design to design cars with its own quarter-scale wind tunnel. The studio produced the Jiotto Caspita supercar, which never went into production due to the recession.\r\n\r\nDome continued to compete with Lammers, Keiji Matsumoto, Ross Cheever and Thomas Danielsson, driving until 1992, when Marco Apicella was signed to drive the new Dome-Mugen F103, taking the title in 1994. The Formula 3000 program continued until 1998 with Shinji Nakano, Katsumi Yamamoto and Juichi Wakisaka but without much success.\r\n\r\nFormula One\r\nMain article: Dome F105\r\nLate in 1995, Tadashi Sasaki, joined Dome and that autumn the company announced its plan to enter F1 with a car designed by Akiyoshi Uko called the Dome F105, using a Minardi transmission and hydraulic system. Apicella was installed as test driver in 1996 and the test driving duties were later taken over by Nakano and Naoki Hattori. The planned 1997 World Championship effort came to nothing and the follow-up car, the Dome F106, never materialised due to lack of sponsorship and Mugen's refusal to supply engines. The Concorde Agreement also delayed the start for the team. By 1999, all development work would fold after Honda's involvement with British American Racing.\r\n\r\nRecent projects\r\n\r\nA Dome S101.5 run by T2M Motorsport in 2007.\r\nIn 1999 Dome established Dome Cars Ltd. in the United Kingdom and the Dome Tunnel in Maihara, Shiga Prefecture, which was originally intended for F1 construction. The company also focused its effort in the Japanese GT Championship, which they had been since 1996 and also competing as a team as well as building the Honda NSX for other factory supported teams. They also worked on the aerodynamics on the JTCC Honda Accord.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, DOME Carbon Magic was formed in Mishima, Shizuoka Prefecture, specifically for carbon composite development and manufacture. It continued to build and race the Honda NSX in the recently-renamed Super GT series, with Takata as the main sponsor.\r\n\r\nDome also upgraded their Dome S101 Le Mans prototype chassis to meet new regulations for 2007. The new car has been dubbed the S101.5. These S101s were supplied to Racing for Holland. In 2008, Dome introduced a closed-cockpit prototype called the S102 for the Le Mans Prototype 1 (LMP1) class and entered in the 2008 24 Hours of Le Mans after an absence of 22 years.\r\n\r\nIn February 2012, Dome announced that it will enter an updated S102 in the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans. The updated car, designated the S102.5, will be powered by a 3.4L Judd V8. In a departure for Dome, the team will self-fund race operations, rather than lease their car to a separately funded race team. Dome allied with Pescarolo for race operations until the latter dissolved, and have instructed its team to focus development on outright speed over one lap, rather than on reliability or endurance pace for a 24-hour race.\r\n\r\nIt also produces the Jiotto Caspita.",
