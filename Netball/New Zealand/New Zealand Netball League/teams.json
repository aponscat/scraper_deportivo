The Pulse were formed as an amalgamation of the Western Flyers and Capital Shakers teams from the National Bank Cup (NBC), and competed in the former ANZ Championship from 2008–16, before joining the ANZ Premiership. The team represent regions from the Lower North Island.\r\n\r\nIn 2018 the Pulse are coached by Yvette McCausland-Durie, who also coached the Pulse for three years in the ANZ Championship. Former Silver Ferns captain Sandra Edge is the team's assistant coach, with current Silver Ferns vice captain Katrina Rore as captain. Home games are usually played at TSB Arena in Wellington, although some games are played in Napier, Palmerston North and Porirua. The team uniform is primarily yellow, in line with the Wellington-based Hurricanes rugby union team who play in Super Rugby.\r\n\r\nThe Central Pulse have struggled since their inaugural season. After their first three seasons the team had only won two matches, finishing in the bottom two placings of the competition each time. The Pulse have gradually improved finishing 8th overall in 2011, 7th in 2012 and their best performance of 5th, missing out on a finals berth only by percentage against New Zealand rivals the Waikato\/BOP Magic.",

The team was one of the founding teams in the National Bank Cup, formerly the premier netball competition in New Zealand (1998–2007), during which the team was known as the Canterbury Flames. After the NBC was retired in 2007, the Flames became a founding franchise of the new trans-Tasman ANZ Championship and changed their name to the Canterbury Tactix. In 2013 they changed their name to Mainland Tactix, to clearly state what region they are from. The Mainland team represent the New Zealand regions of Canterbury, West Coast, Nelson and Marlborough.\r\n\r\nThe Tactix have had mixed results during their competitive history. The \"Flames\" finished second in four seasons of the NBC, but since the start of the ANZ Championship the \"Tactix\" have finished no higher than sixth.\r\n\r\nHome games for the Tactix are played at the 7200-seat Horncastle Arena in Christchurch. In 2012 it was announced that a game would be played in Nelson for the first time. The team uniform is primarily red and black, in line with traditional Canterbury Rugby Union colours. Their alternate uniform has the black and red colours reversed.\r\n\r\nIn 2019 \"The Good Oil\" became the naming right sponsor for the Tactix . Prior to this they have had naming sponsors such as Silvermoon in 2017, Easiyo In 2012 and Mercury Energy In 2009.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "The Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic are a New Zealand netball team based in Waikato that currently compete in the ANZ Premiership. The franchise was formed in 1999 during the Coca-Cola Cup (later the National Bank Cup) as an amalgamation of two teams from the inaugural season, the Waikato Wildcats and the Bay of Plenty Magic. After the National Bank Cup was retired in 2007, the Magic joined four other New Zealand franchises in the new ANZ Championship, representing the New Zealand regions of the Waikato and the Bay of Plenty. The ANZ Championship ended in 2016, and the Magic joined five other New Zealand teams in the new ANZ Premiership competition the following year.\r\n\r\nHome games are usually played at Mystery Creek Events Centre in Hamilton, although some matches are played at the Energy Events Centre in Rotorua and the Queen Elizabeth Youth Centre in Tauranga. The team uniform is primarily black with yellow and orange stripes, in line with traditional Waikato Rugby Union colours. Their alternate uniform has the black and yellow colours swapped around. In 2018 the Magic are coached by Margaret Forsyth, with former Magic captain Amigene Metcalfe as assistant coach; Silver Ferns veteran Casey Kopua continues her role as captain.\r\n\r\nThe Magic won two National Bank Cup titles, in 2005 and 2006. During the ANZ Championship, their playing roster has consistently included a large number of international players, which has been both a point of controversy and has been attributed with bringing about their initial success in the competition. The Magic won the 2012 ANZ Championship becoming the first New Zealand and only team to win the competition.",
