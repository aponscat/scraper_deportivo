            "strDescriptionEN": "The Georgia Force is the name of three separate versions of Arena Football League (AFL) teams based in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area of Georgia, United States, that played in the South Division of the American Conference. \r\nThe first incarnation of the Force resulted from the relocation of the original Nashville Kats franchise in 2001 and beginning play in 2002 at Philips Arena in Atlanta, then relocated to The Arena at Gwinnett Center in Duluth, Georgia\r\n in 2003, then back to Philips in 2005.  Following the termination of \r\noperations of the Arena Football League on August 4, 2009, Georgia Force\r\n officials quickly followed with a release that indicated that they, \r\ntoo, were ceasing operations.  The franchise was last owned by Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank.\r\nIn 2010, the Alabama Vipers announced they would leave Huntsville, and would move to suburban Atlanta as the second incarnation of the Force for the 2011 AFL season, once again playing home games at Arena at Gwinnett Center.\r\n  That team was owned by Doug MacGregor and Donn Jennings.  Following \r\nthe 2012 season, the franchise folded citing, \"The market never \r\nresponded to our extensive marketing and sales campaign,\" said team \r\npresident Corey Remillard. \"With all of the outreach, marketing, \r\ncommunity and public relations that we put forward, it would have been \r\nimpossible to not know that we were playing here, and the city simply \r\ndid not respond. Atlanta is simply not a football town.\"\r\nA third version of the Force was announced in November 2023 to \r\nbegin play in 2024 in the Atlanta area, this time as a full-blown \r\nexpansion team with no ties to the original two.  The new Force will \r\nplay their home games at the Georgia State Convocation Center in Atlanta.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "The Louisiana VooDoo are a professional arena football team based in Lafayette, Louisiana. They are members of the Arena Football League and will play their home games at Blackham Coliseum in Lafayette starting in 2024.\r\nThis team is the latest incarnation formerly known as the New Orleans VooDoo with the original and second incarnations being members of the East Division of the American Conference of the AFL and played their home games in Smoothie King Center at different times between 2004 and 2015.  The VooDoo were unrelated to an earlier AFL team, the New Orleans Night, who had competed in the 1991 and 1992 AFL seasons in the Louisiana Superdome.\r\nThe original New Orleans VooDoo played in the AFL from 2004 to \r\n2008, at which point the league suspended operations. During that time \r\nthey were owned in part by Tom Benson, who also owned the National Football League's New Orleans Saints.\r\n  At the completion of the 2008 season, VooDoo owner Tom Benson \r\nannounced the disbanding of the VooDoo.  This led to the termination of \r\noperations for the AFL and ultimate filing by the League of Chapter 11 \r\nBankruptcy.  The minor league affiliate of the AFL, af2, continued play through the 2009 season.\r\nIn the Fall of 2009, several af2 owners, Paul Ross of the Tulsa Talons, Dan Newman of the Bossier-Shreveport Battle Wings, and Brady Nelson of the Spokane Shock, spearheaded in conjunction with Brett Bouchy, former owner of the AFL's Arizona Rattlers and Orlando Predators,\r\n a move to purchase the assets of the AFL out of Bankruptcy.  This \r\nsuccessful transaction resulted in the reformation of the AFL for the \r\n2010 season.  Prior to the 2010 season, the af2 league terminated \r\noperations.  Several af2 teams chose to move into the AFL, including the\r\n Talons, BattleWings, Iowa Barnstormers, Spokane Shock, Tennessee Valley Vipers, and Boise Burn.\r\n  Prior to the 2011 AFL season, several AFL teams relocated: The Talons \r\nmoved from Tulsa to San Antonio; the Vipers moved from Huntsville, \r\nAlabama to Atlanta, Georgia, and reactivated the Georgia Force;  the \r\nBattleWings left Bossier City for New Orleans and reactivated the New \r\nOrleans VooDoo.  Legendary AFL player\/coach Derek Stingley coached the VooDoo for the 2011 season and was replaced in 2012 by longtime AFL quarterback and coach Pat O'Hara.  In 2015, the VooDoo's final season, Dean Cokinos was the head coach.  At the completion of the 2015 season, the New Orleans VooDoo ceased operations.\r\nThe VooDoo's official mascots were known as Bones and Mojo. Their cheerleaders were known as the VooDoo Dolls.",
