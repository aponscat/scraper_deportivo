The team starts in the 2023 season in the European League of Football (ELF).\r\n\r\nAfter establishing in 2007, the team participated in the lowest league without noticeable success until 2015, reaching play-off for the first time.\r\n\r\nIn 2016 a new football program started: the team moved to First Field, the first Hungarian American football stadium, and finished runners-up in tier 3, promoted into tier 2. In 2017 the Enthroners won Division I undefeated, and since then they participate in the HFL. I 2018 they finished in the 5th place, but in 2019, after finishing 3rd place in the regular season, they won Hungarian Bowl XIV. In 2021 they lost the final after an undefeated regular season, but in 2022 they won the HFL undefeated.\r\n\r\nSince 2018 the Enthroners are participating in the Austrian lower leagues. By the rules they had to compete in Divisions 4, 3 and 2, before promoting to Division 1 (second highest division in Austria). Despite the winning lower divisions the Austrian Federation did not allowed to skip any divisions, so Enthroners had to play in all 4 lower tiers. As the since 2022 the Austrian Federation does not allow to promote teams into top level AFL to stabilize the 10 participating teams' positions, Enthroners were not allowed to play in the top division.\r\n\r\nIn 2021 they entered the Central European Football League, but because of the Covid-related travel issues the Calanda Broncos won the match without playing.\r\n\r\nIn 2022 the team participated in the CEFL Cup, won the Southern group and entered the final against Prague Lions. With a 24:20 victory on their home field they won the title.\r\n\r\nOn May 13, 2022, during a press conference in was announced than the Enthroners will enter the European League of Football in 2023.",

Palle Navntoft Christensen was appointed as the Storm's first general manager. On October 3, former NFL offensive coordinator and Munich Ravens head coach John Shoop was named as the Nordic Storm's first head coach.\r\n\r\nThe Storm will play their inaugural season at Gladsaxe Stadium in Søborg.",
