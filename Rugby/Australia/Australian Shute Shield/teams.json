The District team's colours were chosen to represent to new club, whilst Beach's homeground, Manly Oval, was used for the merged club. Manly joined the first grades in 1906, but have roots back to 1884. The current club colours of red and blue came into being in the late 1900s. The club were a great force in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1950 Manly won both the first grade and reserve grade titles in the same season. However, there were no titles for over 30 years, until 1983, under coach Alan Jones, though the club, while playing entertaining running rugby, could not produce consistent results. In 1997 the club again won the first grade title. In 2006 Manly celebrated 100 years of rugby.",
