The Cheetahs have won the Currie Cup six times, with five of the wins coming since 2005, including winning the cup three times consecutively from 2005 to 2007. Since the advent of professionalism in rugby union, they have been considered one of South Africa's \"Big 5\" provincial rugby Unions.\r\n\r\nThe Cheetahs are a very well supported team across the Free State as well having large fan bases in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Pretoria. They are also known as the darlings of South African rugby, with many other South African rugby fans adopting them as their second team especially when they take on any of the other \"Big 5\" teams. The Cheetahs average home crowds of approximately 17,000 in the Currie Cup when they play at Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein. Their biggest rivals are traditionally Western Province. However, in recent times the Blue Bulls have also become fierce rivals of the Cheetahs.",

They were previously known as the Cats between the 1998 and 2006 seasons. They had varied results in the competition, finishing at the bottom of the table six times (in 1998, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2010 and 2012), but reaching the semifinal stage five times (in 2000, 2001, 2016, 2017 and 2018). They reached their first final in 2016 – where they lost to the Hurricanes 20–3 in Wellington – and repeated the feat in 2017, losing 17–25 to the Crusaders in Johannesburg. The team reached their 3rd consecutive final in 2018 when they lost against the Crusaders 38–17 in Christchurch. The team plays its home matches at Ellis Park Stadium.\r\n\r\nThe team faced relegation from the Super 14 after the Southern Spears won a court ruling that they should be included in the competition in place of the lowest ranked South African team in the 2006 competition. However, the Spears and the country's national federation, the South African Rugby Union, reached a settlement of their legal case. By the terms of the settlement, announced on 16 November 2006, the financially troubled Spears abandoned their case.\r\n\r\nAs part of a second attempt to introduce Super Rugby into the Eastern Cape, after finishing bottom of the 2012 Super Rugby table, the South African Rugby Union mandated that the Lions be replaced in the 2013 competition by the Southern Kings from Port Elizabeth. The Lions exclusion lasted just one season as they regained their place in Super Rugby for the 2014 season by beating the Southern Kings in a two leg playoff after the Kings finished bottom of the 2013 South African conference.\r\n\r\nDuring the 2016 Super Rugby season play-offs, the Lions defeated the South Island teams (Crusaders and Highlanders) to reach the championship final, in which they were defeated 20-3 by the Hurricanes.",

The Sharks' home stadium is Kings Park Stadium in Durban. They draw most of their players from the KwaZulu-Natal Province. The Sharks are the current representative team of the KwaZulu-Natal Rugby Union, founded in 1890; for most of their history, the team was known simply as 'Natal', with a nickname of 'The Banana Boys' until the mid-1990s when they were re-branded as the Sharks.\r\n\r\nThe team is the third most successful provincial union in the Currie Cup, having won the competition eight times. Natal won its first Currie Cup in 1990, the same year the union celebrated its centenary. Since then the Sharks have won the Currie Cup in 1992, 1995, 1996, 2008, 2010, 2013 and most recently in 2018.\r\n\r\nThe Sharks team that plays in the Super Rugby competition is essentially the same team - they also play in Durban and draw their players from KwaZulu-Natal. For most of Super Rugby history, the Sharks Super Rugby franchise drew players from a much larger area than the Sharks provincial union, with the rugby unions of Border, based in East London and Eastern Province from Port Elizabeth included in the Sharks franchise. Since 2013 the Southern Kings functions on its own, and no longer supplies players to the Sharks franchise.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Western Province (known for sponsorship reasons as DHL Western Province) is a South African professional rugby union team based in Newlands, Cape Town, that participates in the annual Currie Cup and Vodacom Cup tournaments. Founded in 1883, the team has won multiple titles, a record of 34 Currie Cup titles including the inaugural competition, the Vodacom Cup, the Absa Nite Series, and the Lion Cup. The club has the most supporters of any Currie Cup team.\r\n\r\nThe Club is nicknamed Die Streeptruie (\"The Striped Jerseys\" in Afrikaans) in reference to their legendary blue and white hooped jerseys. These Striped Jerseys were the colours of Malmesbury Rugby Football Club, established in 1881. They are also known simply as \"Province\" by all South African rugby lovers, while Afrikaans-speaking supporters also refer to the team by its abbreviation, W.P. (pronounced: \"vee pee\" ).\r\n\r\nWestern Province were the 2012 Vodacom Cup Champions, having defeated the Griquas in 2012 by 20 points to 18. They also are the 2014 Currie cup champions, having defeated the Lions 19–16 in the final. Western Province is the only South African Team besides the Blue Bulls to have appeared in every final of every competition in South African rugby: the Vodacom Cup, the Lion Cup, the Absa Nite Series, the Currie Cup and the Super Rugby Competitions (as the DHL Stormers).\r\n\r\nAnother accomplishment of Western Province, which no South African team has ever been able to match, is the double victories over the All Blacks the first being (10–3) played on 15 August 1928 and again (12–11) on 16 July 1976, while several countries have never been able to beat the All Black team, Province managed this feat. In 2010 province again did a remarkable victory over all of New Zealand's five super unions, this was the first and only time such an accomplishment has been achieved. Province has also beaten the Wallabies 17–6 in a thrilling encounter in 1963. Province has also drawn to other countries including England in 1984 with a score of 15 all, however province has beaten the British and Irish Lions numerous times, including three times in 1903 and won another match in 1924, the match then had been regarded as \"test\" status. The only two teams to have beaten overseas countries as well as combination teams (Lions) are yet again the Blue Bulls and Western Province. Province was unstoppable by any other opposition in the 1980s except for Northern Transvaal. Among the ten Currie Cup trophies in the 1980s 5 went to Province 4 went to Northern Transvaal and 1 was shared, this shows the dominance between the two teams and the constant intense rivalry between the unions.\r\n\r\nSince 1983 Western Province has been sponsored by Adidas, in 2013 this will mark the 30th Anniversary of the sponsorship and the 130th anniversary of the team itself. In 1983 Province launched their centenary jersey of which 50 only ever came into existence, but this is not the rarest province top, the rarest being a complete maroon kit of which only 15 were ever made, this team played under the WP Presidents XV. The maroon jersey along with the centenary jersey as well as the original Stormers orange tops are the three most sought after Province and or Stormers tops.\r\n\r\nTeam sponsor DHL has officially renewed their sponsorship with Western Province until 2016, following an emphatic 2012 season.\r\n\r\nWestern Province currently combines with Boland Cavaliers to compete as the DHL Stormers in the Super Rugby competition.",
