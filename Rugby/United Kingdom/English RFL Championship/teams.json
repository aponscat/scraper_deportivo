Their historic nickname is \"The Chemics\" after the main industry in Widnes, but now they use their modern nickname, \"The Vikings\".\r\nThe club enjoyed a period of success in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, and were frequently described as \"Cup Kings\" reaching the Challenge Cup Final 7 times in 10 years between 1975 and 1984. In 1989, after winning their third Rugby League Championship, Widnes became the first official World Club Champions by beating the Australian champions Canberra Raiders 30-18 at Old Trafford. They have a strong local rivalry with Warrington Wolves.",
