In 1877 a game described as the first to be played under rules took place at Philiphaugh. Indeed, Selkirk sent a team to the inaugural Melrose Sevens tournament back in 1883, and have been trying to win the Tournament ever since.\r\n\r\nThe club has produced twelve Scotland internationalists and several British Lions, including John Rutherford, and Ian Paxton, a very respectable amount when the size of the royal burgh is taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nSelkirk's youth system is set up through Schools rugby at Selkirk High School up until the 3rd year. Through the fourth, fifth, and sixth years, players who wish to continue playing rugby join Selkirk Youth Club. Selkirk Youth Club has had much recent success, being unbeaten league Champions in 2010 and winning the league again in 2012 with one defeat, Border Cup winners in 2011 and National U18 Cup finalists in 2011 and 2012. They also won the National U18 Cup in 2003.",
