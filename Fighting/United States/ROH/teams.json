            "strDescriptionEN": "Ring of Honor Wrestling, also known as ROH Honor Club TV, and often shortened as ROH Wrestling TV, ROH TV, ROH TV on HonorClub, or ROH on HonorClub is an American professional wrestling television series produced by Ring of Honor (ROH). The series features professional wrestlers competing in matches and conducting interviews. Combined, these elements create and further the storylines of the promotion.\r\n\r\nThe pilot episode was taped on February 28, 2009, and the series premiered on March 21, 2009, airing weekly on HDNet in the United States. The series' 100th and final HDNet episode aired on April 4, 2011. The series would return under the same title, airing on television stations owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group on September 24, 2011; such stations being affiliates of The CW and MyNetworkTV. Following the acquisition of Ring of Honor from Sinclair by All Elite Wrestling president and co-founder Tony Khan in March 2022, the show eventually ceased broadcasting on Sinclair's stations; the final episode aired on April 15, 2022. Khan later announced in December 2022 that ROH's weekly televised program will be aired on the relaunched Honor Club streaming platform. The series returned on March 2, 2023.",
