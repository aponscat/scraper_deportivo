            "strDescriptionEN": "The Brandon Wheat Kings are a Canadian junior ice hockey team based in Brandon, Manitoba. They are members of the Western Hockey League (WHL) since joining the league in the 1967–68 season. Previously, they played in the Manitoba Junior Hockey League (MJHL), with the exception of two seasons in the mid-1960s when they played in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL). The team was a successor to the Brandon Wheat City senior team that participated in the 1904 Stanley Cup Challenge, losing to the Ottawa Senators.\r\n\r\nThe team was known as the Brandon Elks for a short time in the late 1930s. They won eight Turnbull Cup Championships as Manitoba Junior Champions in 1939, 1947, 1949, 1950, 1960, 1962, 1963, and 1964. They appeared in the Memorial Cup six times: 1949 (as an MJHL team), 1979, 1995, 1996, 2010, and 2016, losing each time. The team plays its home games at the Keystone Centre. They also played at Wheat City Arena until 1969, and the Manex Arena from 1969 to 1972. Between 1973 and 1980, the Wheat Kings owned and operated a farm team in the MJHL, called the Travellers.\r\n\r\nThe 1949 Brandon Wheat Kings won the Abbott Cup defeating the Calgary Buffaloes. They went on to lose the Memorial Cup to the Montreal Royals. The 1949 Brandon Wheat Kings were inducted into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame in the team category.\r\n\r\nThe Wheat Kings hold the CHL record for most points (125) in a single season, setting the mark in 1978–79.\r\n\r\nThe Western Hockey League announced on October 16, 2008, that the Wheat Kings had been chosen to host the 2010 Memorial Cup championship at the Keystone Centre. They reached the final game, losing to the Windsor Spitfires.\r\n\r\nThe Brandon Wheat Kings mascot is Willie, a coyote\/wild dog hybrid.",

Established in 1994, the team has been owned by the Calgary Flames hockey club since 1997. They are the third WHL team to represent Calgary, preceded by the Centennials and Wranglers.\r\n\r\nThe Hitmen have finished with the best record in the WHL four times, and qualified for the playoffs for thirteen consecutive seasons between 1998 and 2010. In 1999, they became the first Calgary team to win the President's Cup as league champions, and the first to represent the city in the Memorial Cup since the Calgary Canadians won the national junior title in 1926. The Hitmen hold numerous WHL attendance records, and in 2004–05 became the first team in Canadian Hockey League history to average 10,000 fans per game.

On March 19, 2014, after months of rumours, a team of local investors led by Greg Pocock, along with NHLers Dan Hamhuis and Eric Brewer, agreed in principle to purchase the Prince George Cougars.

            "strDescriptionEN": "The Red Deer Rebels are a Western Hockey League junior ice hockey team based in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada.\r\n\r\nA \"Name the Team\" contest ran in Red Deer from October 7 to 17, 1991. The top three ideas from the over 1000 entries were \"Rebels\", \"Renegades\", and \"Centurions\". Rebels management chose the name \"Rebels\". On February 5, 1992, the Rebels selected Mike McBain as their first player in the Bantam Draft. The Rebels' first game was on September 25, 1992 in Red Deer against the Prince Albert Raiders (the Rebels won 6 to 3 in front of 5240 fans). The original owner of the team was Terry Simpson, the original General Manager was Wayne Simpson and the original Coach was Peter Anholt. The Rebels had their first sell-out game at the Centrium on January 9, 1993 (6476 in attendance).\r\n\r\nGoalie Jason Clague was credited with a goal on March 28, 1994 during a playoff game against the Lethbridge Hurricanes. David Hruska scored 5 goals in one game on October 20, 1995 in a game against the Medicine Hat Tigers. BJ Young set a team record for fastest goal at the start of a game at 0:06 of the first period on December 6, 1995, against the Medicine Hat Tigers. On May 28, 1997, the Rebels changed their logo to the current one used. On May 11, 1999, Brent Sutter purchased the team from Terry and Wayne Simpson.\r\n\r\nThe Rebels were a very successful team in the early 2000s winning three consecutive division and conference titles between 2000–01 and 2002–03. This period began with a WHL and Memorial Cup championship in 2001 when Jeff Smith scored the overtime winner against the Val-d'Or Foreurs. The Rebels were unable to duplicate this feat, however, falling in the league championship series the next two seasons.\r\n\r\nPresident and owner Brent Sutter was also highly successful while serving as Team Canada's coach at both the 2005 and 2006 World Junior Hockey Championships. His older brother, Brian, took over the reins of the team for the 2007–08 season. Brent Sutter was named as the new head coach on November 14, 2012.\r\n\r\nThe Rebels had the first overall pick in the 2008 WHL Bantam Draft, choosing Burnaby, British Columbia native Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, who was also selected number one overall at the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. Other notable first round draft picks include Cam Ward, Dion Phaneuf, Mathew Dumba and Jesse Wallin.\r\n\r\nThe Rebels were the host team of the 2016 Memorial Cup tournament.",

The team name was also associated with the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, named for the same Princess, to the point that Pats sweaters still bear the regimental badge and \"PPCLI\" flash as a shoulder patch.

The Wild name and branding was carried forward to the WHL organization. The team was added to the U.S. Division of the Western Conference of the WHL, alongside new in-state rivals Seattle Thunderbirds, Everett Silvertips, Spokane Chiefs, and Tri-City Americans, as well as the Portland Winterhawks.\r\n\r\nOn July 13, 2023, Kevin Constantine was announced as the team's first WHL head coach.
