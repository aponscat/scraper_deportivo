The ice hockey team first appeared in 1967 as AaB Ice Hockey organized under Aalborg Boldspilklub. They play in the Danish national league and won the Danish league championship in 1981. In 1997 AaB Ishockey merged with a smaller club, IK Aalborg. The merged team was known as Aalborg Ishockey Klub (AIK) in the period 1997–2003, but following financial instability in the club, the professional license was transferred to Aalborg Boldspilklub ('AaB’). The team is located in Aalborg in the northern part of Jutland and ceased operations at the end of the 2011\/12 season, where it was put up for sale. In 2012 the team was bought by investors with the majority of the shares owned by entrepreneur and investor Magnus Kjøller. The team was replaced by a whole new team and organisation launched a \"Masterplan 2018”",

            "strDescriptionEN": "The Belfast Giants are an ice hockey team from Belfast, Northern Ireland that compete in the Elite Ice Hockey League. Home games are played at the 12,000-capacity Odyssey Arena in Belfast.\r\n\r\nCurrently the Belfast Giants are sponsored by Stena Line and are known as 'The Stena Line Belfast Giants'. The previous major sponsors were Aer Lingus, LBM, Coors Fine Light Beer and Harp Lager who sponsored the Belfast Giants in sequence since their inception.\r\n\r\nSectarianism had long been seen as a significant problem in some sports in Northern Ireland. When the club was established, the Belfast Giants were keen that the club not attach itself to a particular faith or community, instead wanting to represent Belfast as a whole. A number of policies were subsequently introduced to try to ensure this. Particular clothing (such as association football replica shirts), which might have displayed a person's political or religious affiliation, were banned and flags were not permitted to be brought into the arena. The national anthem of the United Kingdom, traditionally played before games at other arenas in the Elite League, is not played before Giants games. These policies have been successful and the Giants have quickly built a large and enthusiastic fanbase who did not have to fear the sectarianism that marred other sports in Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nInitially members of the now defunct Superleague, the Giants won the championship in 2001–02 and were play-off champions in 2002–03. With the Superleague's demise, there were concerns that the Giants would not survive because of major financial problems which had developed. Running up debts of £600,000 and facing the threat of liquidation creditors voted to accept 20p in the pound allowing the club to continue. One company was believed to be owed nearly £65,000.\r\n\r\nHowever, with the creation of the new Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL) for the 2003–04 season, the Giants survived. The Giants finished 4th in the league's first season, but failed to reach the post-season play-offs..\r\n\r\nThe Giants finished runners up in the 2004–05 season behind the Coventry Blaze but were winners of the Cross-over League Cup, which was played with teams from the BNL.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, The Giants unveiled NHL All-Star and Olympic Gold Medal winner, Theo Fleury who made his debut against the Edinburgh Capitals. The Giants won 11–2, with Fleury scoring a hat-trick. With 4 additional assists and a fight under his belt, he was named man of the match.\r\n\r\nBesides Fleury, several other players who previously played in the NHL have played for the Giants; Paul Kruse, Jason Ruff, Paxton Schulte, and Jason Bowen, Bowen and Kruse having played almost 600 games between them. Kevin Westgarth is the latest incumbent from the NHL to don the Giants jersey, arriving from the Calgary Flames after several seasons in North America's top league.\r\n\r\nWith an average attendance of around 4,023, the Giants are one of two Elite league ice hockey squads among the most popular teams of the continent, along with the Nottingham Panthers.",

It has remained at this level since, being the club with the second-most consecutive years at this level, behind Amiens.\r\n\r\nRouen won its first French league title in 1990 and then appeared in 7 consecutive finals, winning the title in 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995, while finishing runner-up in 1991 and 1996. During that era, the club enjoyed much success, participating in European tournaments, and winning the European League Cup in 1996, and the Atlantic league in 1995 and 1996.\r\n\r\nRouen had less success in the second half of the 1990s, but since then has returned to its winning ways. The team won 8 additional French league titles in 2001, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. During the 2005-2006 season, the team achieved the rare feat of being unbeaten, winning all of their regular season matches except for one tie, and sweeping their opponents in the playoffs.\r\n\r\nWith 14 titles, Rouen has the third-most elite championship titles of any French city, trailing only Chamonix (30 titles) and Paris (18), although Paris won its titles with 8 different teams.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Ilves (pronounced ; Finnish for \"Lynx\") is a Finnish professional ice hockey team based in Tampere. They play in the Liiga at the Tampere Deck Arena.\r\n\r\nThe match between Ilves (yellow and green) and Tappara (blue and orange) on December 3, 2021 at Nokia Arena in Tampere, Finland\r\nThe colors of Ilves, green, yellow, and black, were taken from what was then the coat of arms of the city of Tampere.\r\n\r\nWith sixteen championships, Ilves is the second most successful hockey team in the Finnish championship league, the Liiga, after their local rival Tappara. The club was founded in the spring of 1931, and it played its first game against Tampereen Palloilijat the next winter. In the late 1930s, Ilves won three Finnish championship titles as the first Tampere-based hockey team.\r\n\r\nAfter World War II, Ilves started playing its home games at the then new Koulukatu ice rink. It had another championship spree in 1945–1947 when it stayed undefeated for over four years (albeit playing only 36 games during that period).\r\n\r\nIn 1954, Ilves was for the first and so far only time relegated to the second highest level of Finnish hockey but managed to return to the top tier only one year later.\r\n\r\nThe current logo was designed by Rauno Broms in 1963. In 1965, Ilves moved, along with its local rivals Tappara and KooVee, to the new Hakametsä arena, where they played until 2021.\r\n\r\nThe last Finnish Cup competition in hockey was held in 1971. Ilves won the title and has therefore been the reigning champion since. In 1972, it also won another league championship; its 15th championship in total.\r\n\r\nDuring the late 1970s, Ilves went through lean times. Finally, when Koovee, which was in no better condition, was relegated at the end of the 1979–80 season, the two clubs decided to sign an agreement of cooperation. The best players of Koovee moved to Ilves, the most notable of them being Risto Jalo.\r\n\r\nIn 1985, Ilves claimed its 16th and most recent championship. Along with Risto Jalo, the key players of that team were Raimo Helminen, Mikko Mäkelä, Ville Siren, and Jukka Tammi. Repeating this success proved difficult, however, when in the following summer four players left the team to play in the NHL.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1980s, Ilves had another brief stint of moderate success when coached by Sakari Pietilä. It finished first after the regular season in 1988 but was eliminated in the first round of playoffs. The next year it came away with a bronze medal, and finally in 1990 it reached the finals, only to lose to TPS.\r\n\r\nFor most of the 1990s, the club struggled with financial problems and unclear issues concerning ownership. In sports performance, the low point was in the spring of 1995, when Ilves finished last in the SM-liiga and had to fight the lower league teams SaPKo and SaiPa for their place among the elite for the next year.\r\n\r\nIlves managed to avoid relegation and was promptly reborn as a viable championship candidate, reaching the semifinals in 1997 and the finals a year after that.\r\n\r\nThe 2000s were a fairly mediocre period in Ilves history. After their bronze medal win in 2001, Ilves lost in the first round of the playoffs in six of the next seven seasons and missing the playoffs altogether in 2003. They managed to avoid relegation in 2010, 2012 and 2013.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "HC Dynamo Pardubice is a professional ice hockey club that plays in the Czech Extraliga. Its home venue is Enteria arena located in Pardubice. The club was originally named LTC Pardubice, acquiring its current name at the start of the 2015–16 season.\r\nIce hockey has been played in Pardubice since the beginning of the 20th century. Hockey's beginnings in Pardubice can be traced to the Matiční jezero where bandy, a hockey-like game, was played. This style of hockey was adopted from football – there were 11 players, opposing goals, a ball, and a football-like field. The first match of ice hockey was played in 1913 on the very same lake. \r\nOrganised hockey was founded in Pardubice by Vilém Weiss in 1923, the same year that the club LTC Pardubice was established. Regular competitions first took place during the 1930-1931 season.",
