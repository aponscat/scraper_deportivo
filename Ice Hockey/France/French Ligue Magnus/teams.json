It has remained at this level since, being the club with the second-most consecutive years at this level, behind Amiens.\r\n\r\nRouen won its first French league title in 1990 and then appeared in 7 consecutive finals, winning the title in 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995, while finishing runner-up in 1991 and 1996. During that era, the club enjoyed much success, participating in European tournaments, and winning the European League Cup in 1996, and the Atlantic league in 1995 and 1996.\r\n\r\nRouen had less success in the second half of the 1990s, but since then has returned to its winning ways. The team won 8 additional French league titles in 2001, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. During the 2005-2006 season, the team achieved the rare feat of being unbeaten, winning all of their regular season matches except for one tie, and sweeping their opponents in the playoffs.\r\n\r\nWith 14 titles, Rouen has the third-most elite championship titles of any French city, trailing only Chamonix (30 titles) and Paris (18), although Paris won its titles with 8 different teams.",

The Eagles are members of the Ligue Magnus and play their home games at Palais des sports Jean-Bouin.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nNice Hockey Club\r\nNice Hockey Club was founded in 1969, and initially played in Division 2, at the time the lowest tier of Ice Hockey in France. Following the culmination of the 1979 season, Nice were promoted to Division 1, the 2nd tier. After spending four seasons in Division 1, a fire destroyed Nice's rink, and thus they were relegated back to Division 2. After finding a new rink at the Palais des Sports Jean-Bouin, Nice were promoted back to Division 1 at the end of the 1984 season having won Division 2.\r\n\r\nAfter spending four seasons in Division 1, Nice were once again demoted to the third tier of French hockey, however, following a spate of liquidations, the FFHG were forced to merge the top two divisions, and as such Nice found themselves back in Division 1. The Les Aigles (the Eagles) moniker was adopted by the club in 1994. The Eagles remained in Division 1 until the 1998-99 season, wherein they forfeited the season and were relegated to Division 3. Following a league wide reshuffle, the team was again promoted to Division 2 after the 2000-01 season. Nice would continue to play in Division 2 for two more seasons, before folding due to financial difficulties in 2003.\r\n\r\nNice hockey Côte d'Azur\r\nThe team would return the following season with a new name, Nice hockey Côte d'Azur. In their first season back in Division 3, NCHA finished as champions and promotion to Division 2. The Eagles gained promotion from Division 2 four years later following the culmination of the 2007-08 season. Nice would go on to win the 2015-16 Division 2, and following a play-off final victory against Anglet, they would be promoted to the Ligue Magnus for the first time in the club's history. As of the 2014-15 the Eagles also have a feeder team playing in Division 3.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Rapaces de Gap (French: Les Rapaces de Gap) is a French ice hockey team that is based in Gap and plays home games at the Patinoire Brown-Ferrand. The team played in the Ligue Magnus during the 2009–10 Ligue Magnus season. Gap won the French Championship three times in 1977, 1978 and 2015.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n20th century\r\nThe team was founded in 1937 The club Rapaces de Gap (Gapençais, Gap) was created in 1937; it entered championship of France in 1945 where it played in the second series. In 1955, the team inaugurated the Brown-Ferrand Ice Rink, which became artificial in 1961. The Gapençais started in the first series (elite division) for the 1962–1963 season. From 1962, the Canadian Camil Gélinas, who was coach of the team Athletic Club of Boulogne-Billancourt, became coach of Repaces de Gap at the request of the team's president in 1965. In 1972, work on the stadium, which included covering of the track, allowed the permanent use of the ice, and the hosting of the world championship group C.\r\n\r\nThe senior team was still progressing with Czech Zdeněk Bláha as a coach. The team under Bláha won their first Champion of France title in 1977. Gap also won the title the following year. The club continued thereafter to be a great training club, until the 1980s winning 21 titles of champion of France in the minor categories and being vice-champion of France in 1983–1984. In 1989, the club finished second-from-last in the National 1A but preferred demotion to end their expensive professional adventure.\r\n\r\nFor the 1992–1993 French Hockey Championship, Gap returned to the elite division for the first time, following a reshuffle of the divisions and the retirement from the national league at 10 clubs. In 1996, Gap won Division 1. New immediate descent, when Gap fails to stay in hen.\r\n\r\n21st century\r\nThe club slowly descended the French hierarchy, having to play a dam to stay in Division 1 during the 2001–2002 season. The club recovered their form the next season, thanks to the expansion of the elite to a Super 16. This was a difficult task because with the lowest budget, Gap were often in the bottom of the table, returning to the second level in 2006. In 2009, thanks to a new title Division 1 champion, the club returned to the elite league.\r\n\r\nBetween the start of the 2009–2010 season and the end of the 2012–2013 season, Gap home games were broadcast live on the club's website. Long announced the renovation of the rink would run until August 2012. The rink was refurbished and its capacity was increased to 2,000 seats. During the 2011–2012 season, Gap played their home games at Palais Marseille Grand Est. On October 23, 2012, the club's president Georges Obninsky announced his resignation during a press conference. He was replaced by Philippe Vial and Jérôme Escallier. At the end of the 2016–2017 season, Rapaces de Gap won the Ligue Magnus, thus becoming Champions of France for the fourth time in their history. As of 2019, the club has one of the best records in French hockey with 29 national titles, 37 podiums, 2 participations in the European Cup, 1 cup of As and 22 players selected in National Team including eight for Olympics.",
