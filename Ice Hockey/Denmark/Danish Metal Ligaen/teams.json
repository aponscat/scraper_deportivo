The club was founded in 1961 and play their home games in the Rødovre Skøjte Arena which has a capacity of 3,600 spectators.\r\n\r\nThe club has won the Danish championship 6 times in 1978, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1990 and 1999.\r\n\r\nFrom 1977-1979, the team was coached by Boris Kulagin, the former coach of the Soviet national ice hockey team. Kulagin joined the Danish team after getting fired as head coach of the Soviet national team following a disappointing 3rd-place finish at the 1977 World Ice Hockey Championships. Rødovre had used contacts at the Soviet Embassy in Copenhagen, asking them to find a suitable coach for the team. Much to their surprise, they received the famous World Championship winning coach. The fact that such a high level coach was sent to coach in the then lowly Danish league was seen by many as an additional form of punishment for the poor result at the 1977 World Championships. Under Kulagin's guidance, the team won their first Danish title in 1978.",
