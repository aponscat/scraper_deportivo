            "strDescriptionEN": "The Belfast Giants are an ice hockey team from Belfast, Northern Ireland that compete in the Elite Ice Hockey League. Home games are played at the 12,000-capacity Odyssey Arena in Belfast.\r\n\r\nCurrently the Belfast Giants are sponsored by Stena Line and are known as 'The Stena Line Belfast Giants'. The previous major sponsors were Aer Lingus, LBM, Coors Fine Light Beer and Harp Lager who sponsored the Belfast Giants in sequence since their inception.\r\n\r\nSectarianism had long been seen as a significant problem in some sports in Northern Ireland. When the club was established, the Belfast Giants were keen that the club not attach itself to a particular faith or community, instead wanting to represent Belfast as a whole. A number of policies were subsequently introduced to try to ensure this. Particular clothing (such as association football replica shirts), which might have displayed a person's political or religious affiliation, were banned and flags were not permitted to be brought into the arena. The national anthem of the United Kingdom, traditionally played before games at other arenas in the Elite League, is not played before Giants games. These policies have been successful and the Giants have quickly built a large and enthusiastic fanbase who did not have to fear the sectarianism that marred other sports in Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nInitially members of the now defunct Superleague, the Giants won the championship in 2001–02 and were play-off champions in 2002–03. With the Superleague's demise, there were concerns that the Giants would not survive because of major financial problems which had developed. Running up debts of £600,000 and facing the threat of liquidation creditors voted to accept 20p in the pound allowing the club to continue. One company was believed to be owed nearly £65,000.\r\n\r\nHowever, with the creation of the new Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL) for the 2003–04 season, the Giants survived. The Giants finished 4th in the league's first season, but failed to reach the post-season play-offs..\r\n\r\nThe Giants finished runners up in the 2004–05 season behind the Coventry Blaze but were winners of the Cross-over League Cup, which was played with teams from the BNL.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, The Giants unveiled NHL All-Star and Olympic Gold Medal winner, Theo Fleury who made his debut against the Edinburgh Capitals. The Giants won 11–2, with Fleury scoring a hat-trick. With 4 additional assists and a fight under his belt, he was named man of the match.\r\n\r\nBesides Fleury, several other players who previously played in the NHL have played for the Giants; Paul Kruse, Jason Ruff, Paxton Schulte, and Jason Bowen, Bowen and Kruse having played almost 600 games between them. Kevin Westgarth is the latest incumbent from the NHL to don the Giants jersey, arriving from the Calgary Flames after several seasons in North America's top league.\r\n\r\nWith an average attendance of around 4,023, the Giants are one of two Elite league ice hockey squads among the most popular teams of the continent, along with the Nottingham Panthers.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "The Fife Flyers, established in 1938, are the oldest professional ice hockey team in the United Kingdom. The team has a history of success through the ages, with over 60 Scottish and British cups and titles to their name.\r\nIn late June 2011, the Fife Flyers were confirmed as having been accepted into the EIHL, replacing the Newcastle Vipers for the 2011-12 season. Flyers found the going tough in their first season back in British Ice Hockey's top flight. A combination of icing far less imports and the relative inexperience of the British contingent resulted in Flyers almost inevitably missing the playoffs and finishing in last place.\r\n\r\nDespite this, there were positives to take from their first season in the EIHL. The experience the British contingent gained for example should stand them in good stead for the 2012-2013 season. Their talented roster, made up of key players Casey Haines, Derek Keller and Bryan Pitton were the ultimate Jekyll and Hyde team. Almost unbeatable at FIA, they couldn't buy a win on the road. They finished the league in 7th place which was a net 8th for the playoffs given the conference winners Hull had finished in 8th spot in the league but by virtue of winning the conference, they were seeded 2nd. Fife would go on to play the eventual treble winning Nottingham Panthers over 2 hotly contested legs, winning 4-2 at home before losing an agonising 3-0 in Nottingham and bowing out of the years playoffs.\r\n\r\n2013-14 brought renewed vigour to the team. Another squad overhaul saw only 2 returning imports from the previous year with Bobby Chaumont and Danny Stewart returning to Kirkcaldy. The team, in true Fife Flyers EIHL fashion was again, a Jekyll and Hyde team. The start was poor and it was a long and hard winter for the Fife Flyers players and coaching staff. Changes were made in February and the team were a revelation in the league. They went on an unbelievable run and forced their way back into the playoffs in the very last game of the season. Going one step further this time, they defeated fierce rivals and Gardiner Conference champions, the Dundee Stars 8-4 on aggregate and made the Final Four playoff finals in Nottingham. The semi-final against runaway league winners Belfast was an incredible display of ice hockey with neither team backing down an inch. Sadly, the Giants of Belfast found a way past the mercurial Kevin Regan in net and held on to win 1-0.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "Glasgow Clan (formerly Braehead Clan) is a Scottish professional ice hockey team. It was formed in 2010 as the UK Elite Ice Hockey League expanded into the West of Scotland market, and are based at the Braehead Arena in Renfrewshire. It is currently one of three Scottish clubs playing in the top British league alongside Dundee Stars and the Fife Flyers.\r\n\r\nIn July 2018 the team officially re-branded to Glasgow Clan.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nBraehead Arena previously hosted the Scottish Eagles ice hockey team for a brief period at beginning of the 2002–03 ISL season following their relocation from Ayr. The Eagles disbanded in November 2002 due to financial troubles. When the Superleague’s successor, the Elite Ice Hockey League was formed, initial plans included a new Glasgow-based team as being amongst the founding clubs, but this never materialised.\r\n\r\nFollowing the 2008–09 season, the Elite League lost two teams with the resignations of the Basingstoke Bison and Manchester Phoenix, leaving the league with eight participating teams for the 2009–10 season. The Elite League subsequently announced the formation of the Braehead Clan as a ninth team for beginning with the 2010–11 season. The team's ownership was announced as consisting of several of the Elite League's existing team owners, including Nottingham’s Neil Black.\r\n\r\nThe club began marketing the team through the creation of the 'Braehearts', these were female supporters who would promote the team at events and in the community, they wore specially created 'Braehearts' jerseys, similar to those of the team's home jerseys. The club also held open days which were to attract new potential support. With the arena being based next to the Braehead Shopping Mall, this gave the club good opportunity to further attract new supporters. The Braehead Clan fans are known as the Purple Army. The official mascot for the Clan is a highland cow named Clangus.",

They compete in the top-tier of hockey in the United Kingdom, the Elite Ice Hockey League.\r\n\r\nFounded in October 1992, the Flames originally played in the second tier leagues of British hockey, first the British National League until 2004, and subsequently the English Premier Ice Hockey League until 2017. On February 24, 2017, it was announced that the Flames would become the 12th Elite Ice Hockey League team, joining for the 2017–18 season.\r\n\r\nThe team's head coach is Paul Dixon, who took over after Stan Marple retired in 2007.\r\n\r\nFormation\r\nBarry Dow, an American who sponsored and owned the basketball team Guildford Kings and Bill Hurley established and owned the team as management – the two were new to the sport of ice hockey, and brought in Mike Urquhart as coach and Darrin Zinger as captain.\r\n\r\nKey players signed for the first season included Canadians Sean Murphy and Dave McGahan due to their high scoring at Solent Vikings. In addition a number of British players including goaltender, Mike Kellond; forward, Danny O'Hanlon and defender, Gary Shearer.\r\n\r\nThe Flames' inaugural season began in October 1992; they began, unseeded, in the English League Division One. With the Guildford Spectrum not yet completed, the team had to train at Slough's facility. The Flames played their home games at Alexandra Palace until their new home ice was ready and played there for the first time on 23 January 1993.\r\n\r\nWhen 23 January 1993 finally arrived and the Guildford Spectrum opened, the event was a big one. The area's paid-for newspaper The Surrey Advertiser described the local council's £28 million arena as \"awesome\". Guildford's first game at their new home showed a convincing win with Andy Sparks scoring the first goal at the Spectrum. The team went to the top of the Conference due to that game, a position they held onto for the whole season.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "The Nottingham Panthers are a British professional ice hockey club based in Nottingham, England. They are members of the Elite Ice Hockey League. The team is officially known as the GMB Nottingham Panthers due to a sponsorship agreement with the GMB union.\r\n\r\nThe Nottingham Panthers have won four league titles (two English National League titles, one British National League title and one Elite Ice Hockey League title), five Championships, six Autumn Cups and eight Challenge Cups during their history. Panthers are the only British team to win European club honours with one Continental Cup. They are the only team to have played in every season where a British league championship has been contested and are the only founding member of the Premier Division in 1983 to have continually participated in the top flight league. The Panthers have 16 members enshrined in the British Ice Hockey Hall of Fame and have had 34 players represent Great Britain at the World Championships and in Olympic qualifying.\r\n\r\nThe club was founded in 1946 after earlier attempts to establish a team were postponed due to World War II. During their first eight seasons the Panthers played in the English National League. They joined the newly formed British National League in 1954, which they competed in until its disbandment in 1960. With no league to play in the club also ceased operations. In 1980, players and officials from the Sheffield Lancers relocated to Nottingham and reformed the Panthers. Both the original and modern Nottingham Panthers played their home games at the Ice Stadium until 2000 when the team moved into the National Ice Centre.\r\n\r\nThe Nottingham Panthers have one of the largest fanbases in British ice hockey, averaging over 5,000 spectators per game during the 2014–15 season. Their supporters have shared a number of rivalries with other teams during their history. Currently the Panthers have a fierce rivalry with the Sheffield Steelers. The two sides have played over 200 games, including eleven major finals, since 1992.",

            "strDescriptionEN": "The Sheffield Steelers is a British ice hockey club, from Sheffield, England. It was formed in 1991 (see 1991 in sport) and plays its home games at the Sheffield Arena. It is currently a member of the Elite Ice Hockey League. The club's main (title) sponsor is Sheffield Window Centre.\r\n\r\nIce Hockey existed in amateur form in Sheffield, but the sport began its return to an era of arenas and stadium size crowds with the opening of the Sheffield Arena in 1991 and the creation of the Sheffield Steelers — the ice hockey team that was to occupy the new arena. The Sheffield Arena was built as part of the city's facilities for the staging of the World Student Games, and is a sizeable stadium originally seating 8,500 and located close to the city centre. Ronnie Wood and David Gardener-Brown were at the helm as the Marketing Director at the club and set about promoting ice hockey to a city raised on the footballing success of Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday. Wood had a specific target, seeking to attract children and families to the city's new sporting Arena. As he stated in an interview in Liam Sluyter's A Game of Three Halves (Mainstream Publishing, 1998) \"we were sending guys around schools. We wrote to all the schools in Sheffield and said \"Bring the kids, see the Arena, sit down, experience the whole thing\" \". They also began taking players to local football matches and parading them around the ground with mascots in an attempt to pull in football fans too. Another marketing ploy was to give certain players nicknames to help the crowd associate with the new (and as yet unknown) players. This was an idea hatched by the announcer Dave Simms.\r\n\r\nThe Steelers were named in honour of Sheffield's industrial past, much like the American football team of the same name based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the sharing of nicknames are merely a coincidence. The American football team actually predates Sheffield's team by 58 years and was already popular worldwide due to their dominance in the National Football League in the 1970s. Sheffield and Pittsburgh are considered sister cities.\r\n\r\nThe Sheffield Steelers were the first ever fully professional ice hockey team in Great Britain, and O'Brien suggested that there was a lot of resentment from the followers of other hockey teams who saw them as a \"cheque book hockey club\" able to buy whoever they chose. Likewise, Sluyter questions the authenticity of the majority of Steelers fans in the club's early days. Though he admitted that it was a generalisation, Sluyter suggested hockey fans of teams like Cardiff, Fife and Nottingham were ice hockey fans first and foremost, while Steelers' supporters were only Steelers fans, and knew very little of ice hockey outside of Sheffield. However, it made little difference as Sheffield began breaking several British ice hockey attendance records, and in March of that year added an extra 1,200 seats to the Arena to meet the growing demand.\r\n\r\nSheffield Steelers had begun their first ever season in English Division One of the British Hockey League. One year later Sheffield Steelers won promotion into the British Premier League, before going on to win this in 1995 — the last team to do so before the formation of the new British Ice Hockey Super League (ISL) that year.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday 3 December 2006, the Steelers played in their 1000th ever game. The game was against the Basingstoke Bison at the Hallam FM Arena, for which special orange jerseys had been made for the match. The Steelers lost the game 3–2 and the jerseys were all auctioned off at the game.",
