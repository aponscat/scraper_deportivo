They are members of the East Division of the National Lacrosse League that began play in the 2021-22 season at the MVP Arena. The team is owned by a group headed by former NLL player Oliver Marti.\r\n\r\nThe team relocated from Uncasville, Connecticut, where they were known as the New England Black Wolves. The Black Wolves themselves were a relocation of the Philadelphia Wings. This is also the second National Lacrosse League franchise in Albany after the Albany Attack, who played from 2000-2003 before relocating to San Jose where they were known as the San Jose Stealth.\r\n\r\nThe team was officially named the FireWolves on April 14, 2021 after an online naming contest was held. The final three names considered were Attack, FireWolves and Black Arrows. The team changed its original logo after hearing from Stony Brook University lawyers, who raised concerns about the original logo's similarity to the Stony Brook Seawolves logo.",

On May 22, 2015, team owner John Arlotta announced that the Xcel Energy Center, home of the Swarm, did not renew the contract for the team. Instead of negotiating for a new lease, the Swarm began looking for potential relocation sites and eventually chose the Atlanta metro area.\r\n\r\nIn 2017 the Swarm won the NLL championship title against the defending Saskatchewan Rush 2-0 in a best of three series.",

The team plays its home games at Canadian Tire Centre. The Black Bears began play in the 2024–25 season.\r\n\r\nOn February 20, 2024, John Rodenburg of CFGO Radio reported that the New York Riptide would be relocating to Ottawa following the conclusion of the 2023–24 season and will play their home games at Canadian Tire Centre for the 2024–25 season. The team cited poor attendance and their eviction from Nassau Coliseum as factors in the move. The next day, NLL commissioner Brett Frood made the official announcement that the Riptide would be relocating to Ottawa and rebranding as the Ottawa Black Bears. This marks the first time professional box lacrosse has been played in Ottawa since 2003, when the Ottawa Rebel played their final season in Canada's capital before relocating to Edmonton and later to Saskatchewan, where they are now known as the Saskatchewan Rush.",

They are members of the North Division of the National Lacrosse League (NLL). The team was the first Canadian franchise in the NLL. Oakville resident Jamie Dawick is the current owner of the Rock, purchasing the team after the 2009 season. Since 2014, Dawick has also served as their general manager. The Rock play their home games at FirstOntario Centre which they currently share with both the Hamilton Bulldogs of the OHL and the Hamilton Honey Badgers of the CEBL.\r\n\r\nThe franchise was founded in 1998 as the Ontario Raiders in Hamilton. The Raiders played at Copps Coliseum before being sold to a group of investors led by then Toronto Maple Leafs Assistant GM Bill Watters, who relocated the franchise to Toronto. They were subsequently renamed the \"Toronto Rock\", and began play at Maple Leaf Gardens in the 1999 season. The Toronto Rock won their 6th league championship on May 15, 2011. They hold a tie for the most championships in league history with the Philadelphia Wings. In the 2001 season, the Rock moved from the Maple Leaf Gardens to Scotiabank Arena (then known as Air Canada Centre) where they played for 20 seasons. On May 11, 2021, the team announced the relocation from Scotiabank Arena in Toronto to FirstOntario Centre in Hamilton, beginning with the 2021–22 NLL season in December. The team continues to represent Toronto while playing home games in Hamilton.",
